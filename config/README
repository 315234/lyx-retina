README for LyX configure stuff
Author: Jean-Marc Lasgouttes (Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the things used to build the configure
scripts. The file present here are the following:

makefile		a simple makefile to build configure script
acconfig.h		template file describing src/config.h.in
aclocal.m4		local macros for configure.in
configure.in		the template from which configure is built
lib_configure.m4	the template from which lib/configure is built
install-sh		shell script used when no good install program
			is found
mkinstalldirs		shell script used to create installation dirs.
stamp-h.in		file used by Makefile to check dependencies
hack-gcc		a shell script to work around possible gcc bugs

How to use the makefile
-----------------------

When you make a modification to some configure component, just type
'make', with the config/ directory being current. This will create
configure, lib/configure and config.h.in. Do *not* try to run directly
autoconf or autoheader. Note that these scripts require autoconf 2.12
or later.

There is also a target 'clean' which delete backup files, etc.

Note: please do not rename `makefile' to `Makefile'! This name was
chosen in order avoid being excluded from LyX patches...
