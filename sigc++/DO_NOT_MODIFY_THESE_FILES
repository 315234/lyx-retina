These files are all collected together from a checked out copy of the
libsigc++ CVS repository by the ../development/tools/makeLyXsigc.sh file.
Some of these files are modified by that script.  If you need to fix a bug in
the code then you should try to get the latest CVS libsigc++ and regenerate
this entire subpackage. If the problem still persists it may be necessary to
modify the generation script.

If an error is found while porting to a new platform read the doc/requirements
file.

Remember to contact the LyX developers list if you are having problems.
