This is a list of questions and answers that I have collected from
messages to my mailbox

--------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Q: Why isn't sigc++config.h installed with the rest of the headers?

A: Traditionally include files that are dependent on the compiler
   or srchitecture belong under lib trees and not the include tree.
   This allows machines to share include directories on large multiuser
   systems.

   Examples:
     /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.57/include 
     /usr/lib/glib/include
     /usr/lib/qt/include

   To access that file you should include a -I PREFIX/lib/sigc++/include
   in your compiler switchs.

   This can be done for you automatically through the use of 
   the sigc-config script.  

     c++ myfile.cc `sigc-config --cflags --libs`

   Last, if you really don't like this just symlink the file into
   PREFIX/include.  (Don't copy or the next version of libsigc++ 
   very likely won't work right!) 

Q: Why on Visual C++ can do I get piles of errors when trying to
   use classes which contain Signals?  

A: Visual C++ requires all classes which are parameterized to be
   explicitely exported.  This is the same problem encountered 
   when using STL classes in VC++.  Microsoft Knowledge Base
   article Q168958 contains the solution.

   (http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q168/9/58.ASP)

   You will need to create an export file with all the signals,
   slots, and parameterized functions explicitely instantiated
   and include it in your library source.  (Anyone have an example
   of this?)
