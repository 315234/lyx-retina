What's new in LyX version 1.1.3?
--------------------------------

More LyX internals have been cleaned-up in this version, but the usual
small number of user-visible changes have appeared:

- LyX is not able anymore to read some old files using latex inset
  (this should not be a problem as these were already not generated by
  LyX 0.12.0). Use LyX 1.0.4 to read files containing those.

- The first line of a .lyx file does not contain anymore the file
  creator name and the date of creation; this was causing various
  problems. 

- the -dbg command line switch is enhanced. For example, "-dbg lyxrc"
  works now. 

- Slightly better handling of dependency tracking for bibtex files.

- The screen representations of \varepsilon and \epsilon have been
  swapped. Now \epsilon shows as red text, and \varepsilon shows as it
  should. This is of course a controversial change (since many people
  will find that their lyx workscreen is suddenly full of red), but done
  for the sake of correctness.

- The characters \angle and \vee are now correctly displayed in math
  formulas; the glyph for \Upsilon has been changed.

- Characters '~' and '^' are now output using standard LaTeX macros,
  which improves the result with T1 fonts.

- new function "command-sequence" to bind several sequences to a key.

- The textclass g-brief has been updated.

And of course many bugs have been fixed.

What's new in LyX version 1.1.2?
--------------------------------

LyX 1.1.2 is a minor upgrade to 1.1.1, only one new feature has been added:

- the export to html feature has been extended to use other programs.
  Currently, tth, latex2html and hevea are supported. Note that the
  variable \tth_command has been renamed to \html_command in lyxrc.

Moreover, a couple of semi-serious bugs have been fixed:

- a bug that caused a crash in lyxstring::find

- the annoying '-' vs. '_' bug.

Also the cheaders files were missing from the 1.1.1 distribution, that
has also been fixed.

What's new in LyX version 1.1.1?
--------------------------------

LyX 1.1.1 marks an important change in our development scheme. While
it does not have many new features, there have been many internal
changes, many of which have been backported from our old development
branch (which is now extinct). So while on the surface this version is
very similar to version 1.0.4, many things happened under the hood. As
a consequence of this: expect that some new bugs have crept in.

User visible changes in lyx 1.0.1: 

- New export to HTML feature

- All the popups should be more resistant to resize actions.

- normal spaces are automatically made unbreakable if we are in
  a freespacing mode (LyX-Code), but not in latex mode. The rule used
  to be that spaces where changed when in typewriter font.

- the default encoding of a new document is now latin1, since it seems
  to be a reasonable default for many people. Note that you can
  override this default with the "Save layout as default" feature.

What's new in 1.0.4 compared to LyX version 1.0.3?
--------------------------------------------------

LyX 1.0.4 is mainly a bugfix update to 1.0.3, but some
new features has been included:

- DocBook support.

- RevTeX4.

- Better printing with custom pagesizes.

- Several language files updated.

- And several bugfixes to math and table.

What's new in 1.0.3 compared to LyX version 1.0.2?
--------------------------------------------------

LyX 1.0.3 is mainly a bugfix update to 1.0.2.

- improved dependency tracking when running LaTeX (fixes one important
  bug in 1.0.2).

- new italian and walloon localizations of the user interface.

- New slovene and spanish translations of the Tutorial.

What's new in 1.0.2 compared to LyX version 1.0.1?
--------------------------------------------------

LyX 1.0.2 is a minor update to LyX 1.0.1. Besides fixing many bugs
compared to version 1.0.0, it adds the following features:

- Improved reLyX: supports EPS image inclusion and works in windows.

- New french translation of Intro.lyx and Tutorial.lyx; new german
  translation of UserGuide.lyx.

- Better multipart document support.

- LyX is now able to parse your BibTex files and show a list of
  entries. 

- New broadway textclass (for plays).


What's new in 1.0.1 compared to LyX version 1.0.0?
--------------------------------------------------

LyX 1.0.1 is a minor update to LyX 1.0.0. Besides fixing many bugs
compared to version 1.0.0, it adds the following features:

- Support for selecting pages and number of copies in print dialog

- New function 'Replace all' in Find&Replace popup

- Support for optional argument of \sqrt in math editor

- Support for literate programming with the 'noweb' program

- New LaTeX document classe: APA 



What's new in 1.0.0 compared to LyX version 0.12.0?
----------------------------------------------------

LyX 1.0.0 is a stable release. Besides fixing many bugs compared to
version 0.12.0, it adds the following features:

- much improved reLyX script: many bugs have been fixed, new options
  have been added, many constructs are now correctly handled. reLyX is now 
  installed along with LyX and has its own man page. Separate upgrades
  of reLyX will be made available later.  The reLyX script is utilized
  by the File->Import LaTeX command in LyX.

- Much improved LinuxDoc (sgml-tools) support: multiple textclasses,
  footnotes, and generally better output.

- New textclasses scrartcl, scrbook, scrreprt and scrlettr
  implementing the corresponding classes of the koma-script
  package. New textclasses latex8 for some IEEE journals, IEEEtran for
  various IEEE Transactions journals and ejour2 for some Springer Verlag
  Journals.  New textclass hollywood to typeset your own film scripts.

- Better support (keyboard bindings, keyboard mappings, and/or menu
  and error message translations) for several languages.

- Documentation has been partly translated to German, Swedish, and Czech. You
  will get this automatically from the Help menu if you set up the LANG
  environment variable correctly (i.e. to 'de' or 'sv').

- Documentation has been generally improved and expanded.

- Improved table support.

- Support for arbitrary line spacing in documents.

- easier handling of index entries.

- The printer configuration scheme has changed a bit to help people
  whose dvips is not configured correctly. As a consequence, you might
  have to modify your lyxrc a bit. All users are advised to re-run
  Option->Reconfigure to update LyX configuration.


Note that your existing global lyxrc file will not be overwritten by
default since now LyX only installs a file lyxrc.example to use as
template.
