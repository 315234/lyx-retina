/* Fix labels are printed flushright, manual labels flushleft.

 * MARGIN_DYNAMIC and MARGIN_STATIC are *not* for LABEL_MANUAL.
 * This seems a funny restriction, but I think other combinations are

/* There is a parindent and a parskip. Which one is used depends on the
 * paragraph_separation-flag of the text-object.
 * BUT: parindent is only thrown away, if a parskip is defined! So if you
 * want a space between the paragraphs and a parindent at the same time,
 * you should set parskip to zero and use topsep, parsep and bottomsep.
 *
 * The standard layout is an exception: its parindent is only set, if the
 * previous paragraph is standard too. Well, this is LateX and it is good!
