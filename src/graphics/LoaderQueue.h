 * This implements a threaded service queue which loads images on background.
 * In order to request an image loading you call touch() with the pointer to
 * the cached image. Then it will try to satisfy the request as soon as
 * posible (that's it: after finishing an eventual loading on progress)
 * touch() returns inmediately, in order not tu disrupt the flow of the main
 * thread.
 * The service thread is the method loadNext(). It's actually not a thread,
 * but implemented with a timer that comes back every x msec.
