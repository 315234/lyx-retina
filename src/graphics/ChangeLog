	* GraphicsCache.C: Style change from (*it).field to it->field

2001-03-15  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@trylle.birdstep.com>

	* GraphicsCache.h: noncopyable is in namespace boost
	* ImageLoader.h: ditto
	* GraphicsCacheItem.h: ditto

	* GraphicsCache.C (d-tor): Removed the assert, the assumption it carried
	was false and it's not needed anyhow since the shared_ptr's in the cache
	will destroy everything on exit.

	* GraphicsCache.h:
	* GraphicsCache.C: Changed the singleton pattern implementation, the
	former version "leaked" in the sense that it was not deallocated at
	program end.

2001-02-20  Baruch Even  <baruch@ev-en.org>

	* GraphicsCache.C: Changed to use shared_ptr<GraphicsCacheItem>
	instead of a pure pointer.

	* GraphicsCacheItem.[Ch]:
	* GraphicsCacheItem_pimpl.[Ch]: Collapsed them into GraphicsCacheItem,
	removed the reference counting that was inside. Also fixed a bug where
	a temporary file wouldn't get erased.

	* ImageLoader.[Ch]: Changed the semantics of the image_ pointers usage.
	Ownership is now dropped when the caller requests the image_ pointer.

	* GraphicsCache.C: Cleared up the confusion on when and how it is
	emptied.

	* GraphicsCacheItem.C: Indentation change.

	* GraphicsCacheItem_pimpl.C: Fixed the loading logic so that it will
	figure correctly when the image has been loaded successfully.

2001-02-08  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* ImageLoader.C: add a "using" directive.

	* ImageLoader.h: remove extra comma at the end of enum; add an
	std:: qualifier for vector.

2001-01-21  Baruch Even  <baruch@ev-en.org>

	* GraphicsCacheItem.[Ch]: Changes due to the storage of width and
	height in the image itself and minor cleanups.

	* GraphicsCacheItem_impl.[Ch]: Changes due to the switch to use a
	new ImageLoader class instead of the older Renderer class. This
	means change of responsibilities.
