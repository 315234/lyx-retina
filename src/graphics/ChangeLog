	* GraphicsCache.C: Cleared up the confusion on when and how it is
	emptied.

	* GraphicsCacheItem.C: Indentation change.

	* GraphicsCacheItem_pimpl.C: Fixed the loading logic so that it will
	figure correctly when the image has been loaded successfully.

	* ImageLoader.C: add a "using" directive.

	* ImageLoader.h: remove extra comma at the end of enum; add an
	std:: qualifier for vector.

	* GraphicsCacheItem.[Ch]: Changes due to the storage of width and
	height in the image itself and minor cleanups.

	* GraphicsCacheItem_impl.[Ch]: Changes due to the switch to use a
	new ImageLoader class instead of the older Renderer class. This
	means change of responsibilities.
