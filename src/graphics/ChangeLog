	* GraphicsParams.[Ch]:
	* GraphicsImage.C:
	* GraphicsImageXPM.C: properly resolve more warnings about comparison
	between signed and unsigned integer expressions.

	* Makefile.am: add GraphicsTypes.h which I'd carelessly left out.

	* GraphicsCache.C: move connections to the GImage-derived classes to
	the frontends.

	* GraphicsImageXPM.C (copy c-tor): don't copy pixmap.

2002-02-27  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* GraphicsCache.C: improve commentary to graphicsInit and where it
	should really go.

	* GraphicsImageXPM.C (~Data, free_color_table): resolve the crash
	that became a memory leak properly. (Let the shared_c_ptr free the
	color table.)
	(reset, mapcolor): tidy up and introduce a work around for XPM files
	with crappy color entries. Print out a nice friendly message on what's
	gone wrong and how to resolve it properly.

2002-02-27  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* GraphicsImageXPM.[Ch]: more rigorous use of types (signed/unsigned).
	(Data d-tor): introduce memory leak temporarily, to "fix" a crash
	in free_color_table.
	(unique_color_string): use the correct string c-tor.

2002-02-15  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* ImageLoader.[Ch]:
	* ImageLoaderXPM.[Ch]: removed.

	* GraphicsConverter.[Ch]:
	* GraphicsImage.[Ch]:
	* GraphicsImageXPM.[Ch]:
	* GraphicsParams.[Ch]:
	* GraphicsTypes.h: new files.

	* All files. A total re-write of the graphics cache. The cache now
	supports asynchronous file conversion and file loading. Images
	can be cropped, rotated and scaled for display on the LyX screen.
	The old LyXImage and ImageLoader have been combined in a new class
	GImage. Ditto, ImageLoaderXPM's functionality has been moved into
	GImageXPM.

2002-02-07  Herbert Voss  <voss@lyx.org>

	* GraphicsCacheItem.C: use unzipFile() from support/filetools

2002-01-31  Herbert Voss  <voss@lyx.org>

	* GraphicsCacheItem.h: handle filetype without the file extension;
	getting type from contents; handle zipped files

2002-01-27  Herbert Voss  <voss@lyx.org>

	* GraphicsCacheItem.h: added Converting to the ImageStatus enum.

2002-01-17  John Levon  <moz@compsoc.man.ac.uk>

	* ImageLoaderXPM.C: don't set XpmColorKey flag if we don't use it
 
2001-12-19  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <lasgouttes@freesurf.fr>

	* GraphicsCacheItem.h: do not include <config.h> in header files

2001-09-21  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* ImageLoaderXPM.C (runImageLoader): If the pixmap contains a
	transparent colour, then set it to the colour of the background.
	Also take account of the monochrome, grayscale of color
	preferences option.

2001-09-20  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* GraphicsCacheItem.C (convertImage): only convert if "from" and "to"
	are different. Thus, don't delete the "to" if it's the original!

2001-09-01  John Levon  <moz@compsoc.man.ac.uk>

	* ImageLoadXPM.C: remove setting of alloc colour mask,
	  led to crash as we don't define a callback

2001-07-29  Baruch Even  <baruch@lyx.org>

	* ImageLoaderXPM.C (runImageLoader): When loading agree to use non-exact
	colors with closeness of 10000.

	* GraphicsCacheItem.C: Fixed a compilation bug introduced earlier.

2001-07-29  Baruch Even  <baruch@lyx.org>

	* GraphicsCacheItem.C (findTargetFormat): Removed error dialog box,
	too annoying.

2001-07-23  Baruch Even  <baruch@lyx.org>

	* GraphicsCacheItem.C (convertImage): Fixed a bug with regard to loading
	the image after conversion.

2001-07-17  Baruch Even  <baruch@lyx.org>

	* GraphicsCacheItem.h:
	* GraphicsCacheItem.C: Shuffled things a bit to make it easier to switch
	from synchronous to asynchronous and to ease the coming changes.

2001-07-03  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* ImageLoaderXPM.C (runImageLoader): get display information from
	GUIRunTime. 

2001-06-14  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* GraphicsCache.C:
	* GraphicsCacheItem.C:
	* ImageLoader.C:
	* ImageLoaderXPM.C: removed // -*- C++ -*- as first line.

2001-04-17  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@birdstep.com>

	* GraphicsCache.h: inherit privately from noncopyable
	* ImageLoader.h: ditto
	* GraphicsCacheItem.h: ditto

2001-04-16  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* ImageLoaderXPM.C (runImageLoader): #warning triggers an error on Sun
	CC 6.0 as an unrecognised preprocessor directive.  So ensure they're 
	wrapped. 

2001-04-02  Baruch Even  <baruch@lyx.org>

	* GraphicsCacheItem.[Ch]: Changed to used the Converter class instead
	of hard coding ImageMagick.

2001-03-10  Baruch Even  <baruch@lyx.org>

	* GraphicsCache.C: Style change from (*it).field to it->field

2001-03-15  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@trylle.birdstep.com>

	* GraphicsCache.h: noncopyable is in namespace boost
	* ImageLoader.h: ditto
	* GraphicsCacheItem.h: ditto

2001-03-07  Baruch Even  <baruch@lyx.org>

	* GraphicsCache.C (d-tor): Removed the assert, the assumption it carried
	was false and it's not needed anyhow since the shared_ptr's in the cache
	will destroy everything on exit.

2001-02-28  Baruch Even  <baruch@ev-en.org>

	* GraphicsCache.h:
	* GraphicsCache.C: Changed the singleton pattern implementation, the
	former version "leaked" in the sense that it was not deallocated at
	program end.

2001-02-20  Baruch Even  <baruch@ev-en.org>

	* GraphicsCache.C: Changed to use shared_ptr<GraphicsCacheItem>
	instead of a pure pointer.

	* GraphicsCacheItem.[Ch]:
	* GraphicsCacheItem_pimpl.[Ch]: Collapsed them into GraphicsCacheItem,
	removed the reference counting that was inside. Also fixed a bug where
	a temporary file wouldn't get erased.

	* ImageLoader.[Ch]: Changed the semantics of the image_ pointers usage.
	Ownership is now dropped when the caller requests the image_ pointer.

2001-02-20  Baruch Even  <baruch@ev-en.org>

	* GraphicsCache.C: Cleared up the confusion on when and how it is
	emptied.

	* GraphicsCacheItem.C: Indentation change.

	* GraphicsCacheItem_pimpl.C: Fixed the loading logic so that it will
	figure correctly when the image has been loaded successfully.

2001-02-08  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* ImageLoader.C: add a "using" directive.

	* ImageLoader.h: remove extra comma at the end of enum; add an
	std:: qualifier for vector.

2001-01-21  Baruch Even  <baruch@ev-en.org>

	* GraphicsCacheItem.[Ch]: Changes due to the storage of width and
	height in the image itself and minor cleanups.

	* GraphicsCacheItem_impl.[Ch]: Changes due to the switch to use a
	new ImageLoader class instead of the older Renderer class. This
	means change of responsibilities.
