/**

This file, and the embed checkbox in dialogs of InsetGraphics etc, implements
an 'Embedded Files' feature of lyx.


Expected features:
=========================

1. Bundled .lyx file can embed graphics, listings, bib file etc. The bundle
format is used when Document->Save in bundled format is selected.

2. Embedded file.lyx file is a zip file, with content.lyx and embedded files. 

3. The embedding status of embedded files are set from individual insets.

4. Extra files such as .cls and .layout can be embedded from Document->
Settings->Embedded Files->Extra Embedded Files.

5. When Document->Save in bundled format is selected, all embedded files
become bundled. Changes to the external version of this file does not
affect the output of the .lyx file.

6. When Document->Save in bundled format is unchecked, all embedded files
are copied to their original locations.

Overall, this feature allows two ways of editing a .lyx file

a. The continuous use of the pure-text .lyx file format with external
files. This is the default file format, and allows external editing
of .lyx file and better use of version control systems.

b. The embedded way. Figures etc are inserted to .lyx file and will
be embedded. These embedded files can be viewed or edited through
the embedding dialog. This file can be shared with others more
easily.

Format a and b can be converted easily, by packing/unpacking a .lyx file.

Implementation:
======================

1. An EmbeddedFiles class is implemented to keep the embedded files (
class EmbeddedFile). (c.f. src/EmbeddedFiles.[h|cpp])

2. When a file is saved, it is scanned for embedded files. (c.f.
EmbeddedFiles::update(), Inset::registerEmbeddedFiles()).

3. When a lyx file file.lyx is saved, it is save to tmppath()/content.lyx
first. Embedded files are compressed along with content.lyx.
If embedding is disabled, file.lyx is saved in the usual pure-text format.
(c.f. Buffer::writeFile(), EmbeddedFiles::writeFile())

4. When a lyx file.lyx file is opened, if it is a zip file, it is
decompressed to tmppath() and tmppath()/content.lyx is read as usual.
(c.f. bool Buffer::readFile())

5. A menu item Document -> Save in bundled format is provided to pack/unpack
a .lyx file.

6. If embedding of a .lyx file with embedded files is disabled, all its
embedded files are copied to their respective external filenames. This
is why external filename will exist even if a file is at "EMBEDDED" status.
