/** Version Control for LyX.
    This is the class giving the verison control features to LyX. It is
    intended to support different kinds of version control, but at this point
    we will only support RCS. Later CVS is a likely candidate for support.
    The support in LyX is based loosely upon the version control in GNU Emacs,
    but is not as extensive as that one. See examples/VC.lyx for a simple
    tutorial and manual for the use of the version control system in LyX.

    LyXVC use this algorithm when it searches for VC files:
    for RCS it searches for <filename>,v and RCS/<filename>,v similar
    should be done for CVS. By doing this there doesn't need to be any
    special support for VC in the lyx format, and this is especially good
    when the lyx format will be a subset of LaTeX.
