\maketitle
This document contains all sorts of layouts we are supposed to
support, along with weird nestings.

At time you will see that I use subsubsections in weird places. The
intent is just to make sure that I can include a macro-type layout
everyzhere it makes sense.

A normal paragraph
\begin{equation}
x = \sin y
\end{equation}
with maths inside it.

\begin{quote}
An environment...

... with two paragraphs
\end{quote}

\begin{foo}
an unknown environment
\end{foo}


\section{A section}

\section[Hello!]{A section with optional argument}

\LyX{} is a document preparation system. It excels at letting you
create complex technical and scientific articles with mathematics,
cross-references, bibliographies, indices, etc. It is very good at
documents of any length in which the usual processing abilities are
required: automatic sectioning and pagination, spell checking, and
so forth. It can also be used to write a letter to your mom, though
granted, there are probably simpler programs available for that. It
is definitely not the best tool for creating banners, flyers, or advertisements
(we'll explain why later), though with some effort all these can be
done, too.

\subsection{Some paragraph stuff}

A paragraph\footnote{hello} with a footnote and another
one\footnote{hello

there} with several paragraphs \vspace{1cm} aa

and another paragraph

\begin{center}
Some centered stuff
\end{center}

\begin{quotation}
An environment

\subsubsection*{with a command inside it}
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
Another environment

\begin{quotation}
With another one inside it (with same layout)

[this one even has several paragraphs!]
\end{quotation}

\end{quotation}

We can also nest enumerations

\begin{enumerate}
\item Item1
\begin{enumerate}
\item Item1.a

\item Item1.b (there is  a paragraph break in front of this)
\begin{itemize}
\item Item1.b.*
\item Item1.b.*
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\item Item2
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Item1 (appears as Item3 with bug 5716)

Normal paragraph in Item1

\begin{enumerate}
\item Item1.a
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Let's see what happens when normal paragraphs are inserted in lists:

\begin{itemize}
\item the first item

with some explanatory text under it

and a second paragraph for good measure

\subsubsection*{we can even have one as a subsubsection}

\item the second item

\item the third item

\subsubsection*{and a sssection heading inside it (why not?)}
\end{itemize}

What else? Well, we have descriptions:
\begin{description}
\item[ABC] first item
\item[BCD] second one
\end{description}
labelings:
\begin{lyxlist}{00.00.0000}
\item [label~1] first item
\item [label~2] second item
\end{lyxlist}
and bibliography:
\begin{thebibliography}{9}
\bibitem{FOO} Edward Bar. \emph{The Foo Book}. (1999)
\bibitem{FO2} Walter Müller \emph{The Müller Book}. (2004) 
\end{thebibliography}

\section{This is the Appendix}

switch to german:\selectlanguage{german}
Hallo!
\foreignlanguage{french}{some \emph{french}}
back to english:\selectlanguage{newzealand}
and some nested \foreignlanguage{francais}{french \foreignlanguage{german}{nested
\emph{german}} french} english stuff.
Note that we both used \texttt{french} and the \texttt{francais} alias for the
french text, but for some reason this does not work with the
\texttt{newzealand} alias and \texttt{english} for english text.
