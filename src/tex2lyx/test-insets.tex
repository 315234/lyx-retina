support.

\section{Things that work}

Let's start with simple things: a label~\label{lab:test} and a
reference~\ref{lab:test}; note that I have tested ``unbreakable
space'' without warning (and worse than that, I just tested english
quotes too...).

Of course there are other kind of references, like page
reference~\pageref{lab:test}, but also equation
reference~\eqref{lab:test} (from amsmath package), or varioref's
equivalents~\vref{lab:test} and~\vpageref{lab:test}, without
forgetting pretty references like~\prettyref{lab:test}.

We can input files too, like this \input{foo}, or with the include
variant \include{foo}

If you prefer verbatim input, you can choose
between~\verbatiminput{foo} or~\verbatiminput*{foo}.

If you like tables of contents, you will be happy to learn that
the following ones are supported:
\tableofcontents
\listoffigures
\listoftables

There is also some basic support for graphics, in the form
\includegraphics{foo.eps}, or the slightly more elaborate
\includegraphics[height=1cm, width=1cm]{foo.eps}.

Lines can have an \hfill in the middle, or be broken by a newline\\
there are even newlines with weird arguments, but these are not
handled by LyX\\*[1cm]
so we try to use ERT in this case.

Then one has those macros with a long name for a short meaning, like
\textasciitilde, \textasciicircum{} or \textbackslash{}, and the characters
that LaTeX wants to espace because they are active, like \_\&\#\$\{\}\%.

And what about special characters like hyphe\-nation mark,
ellipsis\ldots, and end-of-sentence\@. LyX also sports a menu
separator\lyxarrow and a spif\textcompwordmark fy ligature break.

What else? Maybe minipages, like this:
\begin{minipage}{10cm}
Hi there, I am a minipage!
\end{minipage}

There is also an option to align vertically the minipage:
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.3\columnwidth}
Actually, it is also possible to set the height and the inner position
of the minipage, but the LyX GUI does not use or allow to modify this
information. Nevertheless, tex2lyx converts it as faithfully as possible.
\end{minipage}


\section{Things that do not work (yet)}

\vspace*{1cm}
LyX can do vertical spacing, even with the nifty 'keep' option
