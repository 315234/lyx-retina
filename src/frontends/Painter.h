/**
 * Painter - A painter class to encapsulate all graphics parameters and operations
 *
 * Every graphics operation in LyX should be made by this class. The
 * painter is used for drawing on the WorkArea, and is passed around
 * during draw operations.
 *
 * It hides low level windows system parameters so insets and other
 * clients don't have to worry about them and we can control graphics and
 * GUI toolkit dependent drawing functions inside this single class.
 *
 * The intention for a toolkit is that it uses these methods to paint
 * onto a backing pixmap. Only when expose events arrive via the event
 * queue (perhaps generated via Screen::expose), does the copy onto
 * the actual WorkArea widget take place. Paints are wrapped in (possibly
 * recursive) calls to start() and end() to facilitate the backing pixmap
 * management.
 *
 * Note that the methods return *this for convenience.
