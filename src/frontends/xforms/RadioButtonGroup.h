/** This class simplifies interaction with a group of radio buttons:
 *  one, and only one, can be selected.
 *  The idea is that you register a bunch of radio buttons with
 *  an accompanying value. Then you can get or set the active button with a
 *  single function call.
 *  It is necessary to also group a family of radio buttons in the
 *  corresponding .fd file in order to unset the previously chosen button
 *  when a new one is selected.
