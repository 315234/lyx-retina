These files are generated with qtarch-1.4-6 which can be downloaded
from 

http://qtarch.sourceforge.net/

Currently you also need this patch : 
http://www.movement.uklinux.net/patches/lyx/qtarch-1.4.6.diff
 
Note this is *not* the latest version, as they only support Qt 2.0.

You should compile in the KDE module when you compile qtarch-1.4.
For me this was just a case of a make in the module/kde/ directory,
and then you can add the .so library file in the qtarch GUI.

The files in this and the kde/ directory have the following naming
scheme :

random.dlg         - the dlg file for qtarch
FormRandom.[Ch]    - LyX's notion of the dialog, real implementation modified
                     via functions only
randomdlg.[Ch]     - Derived Qt class, edited by hand. The interface between widgets
                     and LyX FormRandom file
randomdlgdata.[Ch] - qtarch-generated files, not to be touched by human hands

The class names are FormRandom, RandomDialog, and RandomDialogData

Some tips and guidelines for qtarch and the KDE frontend :

o the default button should be the one that causes least harm, unless
  the action can be undone. So Print should default to cancel, whereas
  insert index entry can be undone, so should default to OK

o the dialog should derive from QWidget (set in Properties)

o the dialog should always have the gettext option set

o give every widget a name - useful for the geometry layouts later

o don't bother setting min/max sizes for anything, but do set the size Hint
  stuff appropriately. e.g. QLineEdit's should have a max height specified by
  size Hint, but variable width

o if you map a variable make it the same as the widget name

o radio groups are done automagically based on positioning
 
o grid units are 5 pixels

o set alignment before placing a widget inside a layout, it doesn't seem to
  update properly. Alternatively you can just edit the .dlg file directly

o push buttons are arranged symmetrically across the dialog e.g.  
  <1 stretch> <button> <2 stretch> <button> <2 stretch> <button> <1 stretch>

o for GroupBox and similar, you set the children in the layout manager
 
o do the geometry layouts last. you cannot alter the geometry of widgets
  whilst they're being managed which makes any settings a pain, which
  are useful mainly while editing the dialog in qtarch
  
o when doing layout, add all the layouts before any of the widgets otherwise
  qtarch has a tendency to get confused

o qtarch often produces code that initialises stuff in the wrong order. 
  This is nasty, but usually dumps core so is noticable. Either way, the 
  cheesy perl script checkinitorder.pl will verify the produced files for 
  you - if it complains you need to hack the .dlg file to re-arrange the order.
