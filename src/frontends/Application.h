/// The main application class
/**
There should be only one instance of this class. No Qt object
initialisation should be done before the instanciation of this class.

\todo The work areas handling could be moved to a base virtual class
common to all frontends.

 Model/View/Controller separation in LyX:
 
 1) The Model: \c Buffer

 The Buffer is the in-memory representation of a LyX file format. The
 Buffer does not (should not) have any information on what part of it
 is represented on screen. There is one unique Buffer per opened LyX
 file.

 
 2) The Controller: \c BufferView / \c Painter

 The BufferView is a tool used by the view that translates a part of 
 the Buffer contents into drawing routines. The BufferView asks each
 inset of the Buffer to draw itself onto the screen using the Painter.
 There can be only one Buffer displayed in a BufferView. While there
 is the possibility to switch Buffer inside the BufferView, the goal
 is to instantiate a new BufferView on each Buffer switch.

 \todo Instantiate a new BufferView on each Buffer switch.

 The \c Painter is just a virtual interface to formalize each kind of
 drawing routines (text, line, rectangle, etc).
 
 The \c BufferView also contains a Cursor which may or may not be
 visible on screen. The cursor is really just a bookmark to remember
 where the next Buffer insertion/deletion is going to take place.

 
 3) The View: \c WorkArea (and it's qt4 specialisation GuiWorkArea)

 This contains the real screen area where the drawing is done by the
 Painter. One WorkArea holds one unique \c BufferView. While it could be
 possible that multiple WorkArea share one BufferView, this is not
 possible right now.
 The WorkArea also provide a scrollbar which position is translated
 into scrolling command to the inner \c BufferView.

 The WorkArea use the BufferView to translate each keyboard or mouse
 events into terms that the Buffer can understand:
 - insert/delete char
 - select char
 - etc.

 
 4) The Window: \c LyXView (and its qt4 specialisation \c GuiView)
 
 This is a full window containing a menubar, toolbars, a tabbar and a
 WorkArea. One LyXView could in theory contain multiple WorkArea
 (ex: with split window) but this number is limited to one only for
 now. In any case, there would be only one WorkArea that gets the focus
 at a time.

 Now, concerning the TabBar versus TabWidget issue. Right now, there is
 only one WorkArea and the TabBar just used to tell the BufferView inside
 the WorkArea to switch to this another Buffer.

 With a TabWidget, each Tab would own its own \c WorkArea. Clicking on a tab
 would switch a WorkArea instead of a Buffer.
