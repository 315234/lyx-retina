GNOME FRONT END
===============

Firstly, this stuff is pre-alpha.  I don't use it so you shouldn't
either.  At all, no exceptions :). 

The GNOME frontend of LyX uses libglade to draw the dialogs.  The base
(GnomeBase.C) class handles the drawing and activating of the Dialogs,
for an example of contructing a simple dialog see FormUrl.[Ch]

FormUrl::FormUrl(ControlUrl & c)
	: FormCB<ControlUrl>(c, "FormUrl")
{}



To manipulate a widget you extract a pointer using getWidget(string).

If you look at FormUrl you'll see that there are a number of
helper functions at the bottom of the .C file.  These are
automatically generated by accessors.py

Glade files now must follow the following conventions:

 * The filename should be the same as the .C and .h Files (i.e
   FormTabularCreate.glade) 
 * The root widget should have the same name
 * Functional widgets should have an r_ as the first two characters of
   their name. (see below)

USING ACCESSORS.PY
==================

Usage:

python accessors.py glade_ui_file DialogClass

Accessors.py will write the helper functions to DialogClass.C_gen and
the function declarations to DialogClass.g_gen.  To ensure the widgets
you're interested in are made available using this method, prefix the
widgets name with r_ when you build the dialog in Glade.
