 * ControlConnections.h contains the definition of three controller classes,
 * ControlConnectBase, ControlConnectBI and ControlConnectBD.
 *
 * Together they control the connection/disconnection of signals with the LyX
 * kernel. Controllers of individual dialogs interacting with the kernel through
 * signals/slots will all be derived from ControlConnectBI or ControlConnectBD.
 *
 * A dialog is classed as "Buffer Dependent" if its contents change with the
 * buffer (document). An example would be the Citation dialog. Such a dialog
 * would be derived, therefore, from ControlConnectBD.
 *
 * Conversely, a dialog is "Buffer Independent" if its contents do not change
 * when the buffer changes. An example would be the Copyright dialog. Such a
 * dialog is therefore derived from ControlConnectBI.
