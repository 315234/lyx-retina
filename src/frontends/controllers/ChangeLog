	* ControlBibitem.C:
	* ControlCitation.C: added "using SigC::slot" declaration.

	* ControlCitation.C (getStringFromVector): re-apply Dekel's recent fix
	to FormCitation.C prior to the merger: "Do not put space between
	multiple keys".

2001-03-15  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@trylle.birdstep.com>

	* several files: remove CXX_WORKING_NAMESPACES

	* ButtonController.h: noncopyable is in namespace boost
	* ButtonPolicies.h: ditto

2001-03-14  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* Merging changes from BRANCH_MVC back into HEAD.

2001-03-12  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* Makefile.am: add ControlBibitem.[Ch].

	* ControlBibitem.[Ch]: new files that together define the Controller
	for a Bibitem popup.

	* ControlCommand.h (c-tor): give  kb_action a default value of
	LFUN_NOACTION.
	
	* ControlCommand.C (apply): do nothing if kb_action is LFUN_NOACTION.
	
	* ControlCitation.[Ch]: moved search functions out of class.
	(bibkeysInfo): new method. Returns const reference to private data.
	(searchKeys): added case-sensitive switch. Used only by simpleSearch
	for now.

2001-03-09  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* ControlCitation.[Ch]: added Search functions to the class,
	(shamelessly lifted from Marco's gnome code). I think that these would
	be better as helper functions outside the class, but this is a first
	stab at it.

2001-03-07  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* ControlCitation.[Ch]: (getBibkeyList): removed from class
	ControlCitation.
	(getBibkeys, getBibkeyInfo): added to class ControlCitation.
	(getStringFromVector, getVectorFromString, parseBibTeX): new helper
	funcs. parseBibTeX() is lifted staraight out of Marco's gnome
	implementation of FormCitation.

2001-03-05  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* ButtonPolicies.h: add SMI_NOOP to enum.

	* ButtonPolicies.C (nextState): add if-statement for SMI_NOOP.

	* ButtonController.C (input): add "optimising" if-statement. Actually,
	things don't work correctly without it...

2001-03-02  John Levon  <moz@compsoc.man.ac.uk>

	* ViewBase.h: remove #pragma directive

	* ControlConnection.[Ch] (ControlConnectBI c-tor): add explicit c-tor
	to make g++ happy.

2001-03-02  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* ButtonPolicies.[Ch]: moved from ../ButtonPolicies.[Ch]

	* Makefile.am: added ButtonPolicies.[Ch]

	* ButtonController.[Ch]: ButtonController is split into
	ButtonControllerBase and a template ButtonController class. The base
	class no longer stores a pointer to a ButtonPolicy, but instead
	accesses the actual instantiation of the policy through a pure virtual
	method bp(). This method and the ButtonPolicy itself are instantiated
	in the templatised ButtonController class. This class is derived from
	the GUI-specific GUIBC class, meaning that the frontends know
	nothing about the actual policy decided upon by the controllers.

	* ControlBase.[Ch]: No longer store the View or the ButtonController.
	Instead the actual instantiations are accessed through pure virtual
	methods view() and bc(). The daughter classes are responsible for the
	actual View and ButtonController.

	* ControlCitation.h: the templatised class GUICitation instantiates
	the methods view() and bc(). It also stores the instances of the
	View and ButtonController.
	
2001-02-23  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* ButtonControllerBase.[Ch]: renamed as ButtonController.[Ch]. Class
	also changed to ButtonController.

	* ControlBase.[Ch]:
	* ControlConnections.[Ch]:
	* ControlCommand.[Ch]:
	* ControlCitation.[Ch]:
	* ViewBase.h: Changes associated with this.

2001-01-15  Angus Leeming  <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* ButtonControllerBase.[Ch]: new files. Split Allan's original
	xforms/ButtonController class into a GUI-I class (here) and an
	xforms-specific derived class, to be found in xforms/xformsBC.[Ch].

	* ControlBase.[Ch]: new files. ControlBase is an abstract base class
	from which all Dialog Controllers should be derived. the Controllers
	are GUI-independent, but are designed to control the behaviour of
	GUI-specific implementaions of each dialog.

	* ControlConnections.[Ch]: new files. Classes controlling the
	connections of buffer-independent, buffer-dependent and Inset dialogs
	with the LyX kernel.

	* ControlCommand.[Ch]: new files. A controller for all dialogs for the
	InsetCommand subset of insets.

	* ControlCitation.[Ch]: new files. The test specialisation! A
	controller for the Citation dialog.

	* ViewBase.h: new file. ViewBase is an abstract base class from which
	GUI-specific dialogs should be derived. The functionality that the GUIs
	must now implement is much reduced.
