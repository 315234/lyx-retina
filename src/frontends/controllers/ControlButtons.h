 * ControlButtons serves only to control the activation of the Ok, Apply, Cancel
 * and Restore buttons on the View dialog.
 *
 * More generally, the class is part of a hierarchy of controller classes
 * that together connect the GUI-dependent dialog to any appropriate
 * signals and dispatches any changes to the kernel.
 *
 * These controllers have no knowledge of the actual instantiation of the
 * GUI-dependent View and ButtonController, which should therefore
 * be created elsewhere.
 *
 * Once created, the Controller will take care of their initialisation,
 * management and, ultimately, destruction.
