This file is intended to be a list of stuff that must be done before
we can say the first iteration of the Qt frontend is "finished". It
is incomplete.

Those with asterisks are what I perceive as being "big jobs"

lyx_gui (qt)

	- move out lyxserver
	- do dpi (cannot easily fix)
 
Menubar_pimpl

	- implement openByName

QAbout

	- give good default size 

QCommandBuffer

	- finish off
 
QContentPane 

	- figure out why a scroll doesn't update quickly, which leaves cursor artifacts
	  whilst holding down page down etc. 
 
QDocument

	- implement me. Need MVC (Edwin is on this)

qfont_loader

	- use lyxrc, check for failure, implement available()
