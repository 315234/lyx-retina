 * An instance of Class Forkedcall represents a single child process.
 *
 * Class Forkedcall uses fork() and execvp() to lauch the child process.
 *
 * Once launched, control is returned immediately to the parent process
 * but a Signal can be emitted upon completion of the child.
 *
 * The child process is not killed when the Forkedcall instance goes out of
 * scope, but it can be killed by an explicit invocation of the kill() member
 * function.
