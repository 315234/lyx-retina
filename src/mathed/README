Inset 'Xyz' is implemented by 'MathXyzInset' in 'math_xyzinset.[hC]'


Inset hierarchy:
                                   
                                   MathInset   
                                (abstract base)

          the width_/ascent_     known as characters)

There are only two "real LyXInsets" in here:

Formula       - containing a pointer to a  MathMatrixInset (a misnomer...)
FormulaMacro  - containing a pointer to a  MathMacroTemplate
