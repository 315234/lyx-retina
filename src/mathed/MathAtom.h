/**
Wrapper for InsetMath * with copy-semantics

--

The 'atom' is the major blob in math typesetting.  And 'atom' consists
of a nucleus, an optional superscript, and an optional subscript.

Exactly where the subscript and superscript are drawn depends on the
size, and type, of the nucleus they are attached to.

Ok: Implementing it thusly is not feasible since cursor movement gets
hackish. We use MathAtom only as a wrapper around InsetMath * with value
semantics.

The MathAtom owns the InsetMath * and is responsible for proper cloning and
destruction. Every InsetMath * should be put into a MathAtom after its
creation as soon as possible.
