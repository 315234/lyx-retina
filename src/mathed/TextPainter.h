// FIXME: Abdel 16/10/2006
// This TextPainter class is never used, this is dead code.
/* Georg explanation of current situation:
AFAIK the text painter was used to export math formulas as ASCII art.
The text painter is	like a real painter, but operating on a very coarse
grid of character cells	where each cell can be filled with an ASCII character.
I don't know why it is currently disabled. I do know that we have a bugzilla
request for reenabling it.
