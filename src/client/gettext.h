/*
 * Native Language Support

 * The general idea is that any string that should be translated is handled
 * as follows:
 *	_("string")
 *
 * Static strings are special, obviously and must be flagged as follows:
 *	static str = N_("string");
 *
 * And wherever they are used:
 *	_(str)
 *
 * Every file where there are strings needs:
 *	#include "gettext.h"
 *
 * Remember to mention each of these files in "po/POFILES.in"
 *
 * The main() needs a locale_init() and a gettext_init() in the beginning.

/*
 * General translation notes:
 *   Commands/options are not translated
 *   Debug messages are not translated
 *   Panic/fatal (that should not happen) messages need not be translated
