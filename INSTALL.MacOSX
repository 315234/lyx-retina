Building LyX/Mac-1.5

LyX/Mac is built from the LyX source, the GPL-licensed Trolltech
Qt/Mac library, and a custom application bundle.

You will need the MacOSX development tools. The procedure described
here builds LyX linked with a static Qt library. Also note that
building LyX/Mac requires gcc version 4.0 or higher. (You can check
your version  by entering "gcc -v" in the Terminal; you can change
your gcc version to version 4.0, for example, by entering
"sudo gcc_select 4.0".)


PREREQUISITES

Note: Only Qt/Mac is needed for building official LyX releases, and
so steps 2 and 3 can be skipped in these cases. Those wanting to
build developmental versions must have automake and gettext as
well.

1. Qt/Mac Opensource Edition, version 4. This library is GPL-
licensed and can be downloaded from
<http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/mac/>. To compile it,
create a directory where you want to install QT4. In the following, 
the full path to this directory is called /path/to/QT4
Decompress Qt/Mac in a convenient directory, cd to the top of the
Qt source hierarcy, and enter:

     ./configure -static -no-exceptions -nomake examples -nomake tools -nomake demos -prefix /path/to/QT4
     make
     make install
     cd /path/to/QT4/lib
     rm *.la

2. [Needed only for developmental builds:] automake, version 1.10
or higher (check with automake --version). Probably the easiest
way to get this is to use MacPorts (from http://www.macports.org/)
and install automake using

     sudo port install automake

3. [Needed only for developmental builds:] gettext version >= 0.12
(check with gettext --version). If the installed version is
insufficient the easiest way to obtain a later version is to use
MacPorts (from http://www.macports.org/) and install gettext
using:

     sudo port install gettext

4. [Useful to simplify detection of Qt:] pkg-config >= 0.9.0. Again,
the simplest way is through MacPorts:

     sudo port install pkgconfig


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

In what follows, /path/to/LyX.app is the location where you want LyX
to create the LyX binary. You should substitute something appropriate,
like: ~/Desktop/LyX.app. Also, substitute the appropriate path to
where you installed Qt for /path/to/QT4 (as above).

(a) Official Releases

If you did not install pkg-config, first set the LDFLAGS variable:

     export LDFLAGS="-framework Carbon -framework OpenGL -framework AGL -framework QuickTime -framework Cocoa"

Then, cd to the top of the LyX source hierarchy, and enter:

     ./configure --prefix=/path/to/LyX.app --with-version-suffix=-2.0 --with-qt4-dir=/path/to/QT4 --with-included-gettext --enable-optimization=-O2
     make
     make install-strip

(Note that the --with-version-suffix=-1.6 option will result in LyX's
user's directory being located at ~/Library/Application Support/LyX-1.6)


(b) Developmental Versions (svn checkouts)

Building LyX from developmental sources requires a few more steps.
Instead of the instructions above, do the following:

If you did not install pkg-config, first set the LDFLAGS variable:

     export LDFLAGS="-framework Carbon -framework OpenGL -framework AGL -framework QuickTime -framework Cocoa"

Then, cd to the top of the LyX source hierarchy, and enter:

     ./autogen.sh
     ./configure --prefix=/path/to/LyX.app --with-version-suffix=-1.6 --with-qt4-dir=/path/to/QT4 --with-included-gettext --enable-optimization=-O2  --disable-stdlib-debug
     make
     make install-strip

Note that by default svn versions use some extra debugging code that
somewhat slows LyX down. If it is a real problem, you can pass the
option --enable-build-type=release to configure.
