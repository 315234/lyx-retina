2000-01-20  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/Makefile.am (libsupport_la_SOURCES): added mkdir.C
	and putenv.C

	* src/mathed/formulamacro.C: delete #include "bufferlist.h" never used

	* src/mathed/formula.C: delete #include "bufferlist.h" never used

	* src/insets/figinset.C (InitFigures): use new instead of malloc
	to allocate memory for figures and bitmaps.
	(DoneFigures): use delete[] instead of free to deallocate memory
	for figures and bitmaps.
	(runqueue): use new to allocate 
	(getfigdata): use new/delete[] instead of malloc/free
	(RegisterFigure): ditto

	* some files: moved some declarations closer to first use, small
	whitespace changes use preincrement instead of postincrement where
	it does not make a difference.
	
	* src/kbmap.[Ch]: delete code according to define NO_HASH, it is a
	step on the way to use stl::containers for key maps. 

	* src/bufferlist.h: add a typedef for const_iterator and const
	versions of begin and end.

	* src/bufferlist.[Ch]: change name of member variable _state to
	state_. (avoid reserved names)
	(makePup): removed
	(getFileNames): returns the filenames of the buffers in a vector.

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): added ro

	* src/support/putenv.C: new file

	* src/support/mkdir.C: new file

2000-01-20  Allan Rae <rae@lyx.org>

	* lib/layouts/IEEEtran.layout: Added several theorem environments

	* lib/templates/IEEEtran.lyx: Example theorem environments and a
	couple of minor additions.

	* lib/doc/LaTeXConfig.lyx.in:  Use URL insets for ftp sites 
	(except for those in footnotes of course)

2000-01-19  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyxlookup.C (CloseLyXLookup): set xic=0; after destruction. 

	* src/mathed/math_utils.C (MathedLookupBOP): rewrite to use
	std::sort and std::lower_bound instead of qsort and handwritten
	binarysearch.
	(struct compara): struct that holds the functors used by std::sort
	and std::lower_bound in MathedLookupBOP.

2000-01-19  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/LAssert.h: do not do partial specialization. We do
	not really need it.

	* src/support/lyxlib.h: note that lyx::getUserName() and
	lyx::date() are not in use right now. Should these be suppressed?

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): we do not need the user name here.
	(makeLinuxDocFile): do not put date and user name in linuxdoc
	headers. 

	* src/support/lyxlib.h (kill): change first argument to long int,
	since that's what solaris uses.

	* src/support/kill.C (kill): fix declaration to match prototype.

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_NAMESPACES): fix the macro to
	actually check whether namespaces are supported. This is not what
	it used to do.

	* src/support/lyxsum.C: add a using directive.

2000-01-17  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/kill.C: if we have namespace support we don't have
	to include lyxlib.h.

	* src/support/lyxlib.h: use namespace lyx if supported.

2000-01-14  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/date.C: new file

	* src/support/chdir.C: new file

	* src/support/getUserName.C: new file

	* src/support/getcwd.C: new file

	* src/support/abort.C: new file

	* src/support/kill.C: new file

	* src/support/lyxlib.h: moved all the functions in this file
	insede struct lyx. Added also kill and abort to this struct. This
	is a way to avoid the "kill is not defined in <csignal>", we make
	C++ wrappers for functions that are not ANSI C or ANSI C++.

	* src/support/lyxsum.C (sum): use #ifdef MODERN_STL_STREAMS
	instead of #if __GLIBCPP__. Since lyxsum is now put inside struct
	lyx it has been renamed to sum.

2000-01-14  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/text.C: add using directives for std::min and std::max.

2000-01-13  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/texrow.C (getIdFromRow): actually return something useful in
	id and pos. Hopefully fixes the bug with positionning of errorbox
	insets. 

	* src/lyx_main.C (easyParse): output an error and exit if an
	incorrect command line option has been given.

	* src/spellchecker.C (ispell_check_word): document a memory leak.

	* src/bufferlist.C (write): fix mismatched allocation/deletion,
	where a "struct utimbuf" is allocated with "new" and deleted with
	"delete[]". 

2000-01-13  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/text2.C (CutSelection): don't delete double spaces.
	(PasteSelection): ditto
	(CopySelection): ditto
	
	* src/text.C (Backspace): don't delete double spaces.

	* src/lyxlex.C (next): fix a bug that were only present with
	conformant std::istream::get to read comment lines, use
	std::istream::getline instead. This seems to fix the problem.

2000-01-12  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/text2.C (DeleteEmptyParagraphMechanism): fix for the "not
	allowed to insert space before space" editing problem. Please read
	commends at the beginning of the function. Comments about usage
	are very welcome.

	* src/text.C (InsertChar): fix for the "not allowed to insert
	space before space" editing problem.

	* src/text2.C (DeleteEmptyParagraphMechanism): when
	IsEmptyTableRow can only return false this last "else if" will
	always be a no-op. Commented out.

	* src/text.C (RedoParagraph): As far as I can understand tmp
	cursor is not really needed.

	* src/lyxtext.[Ch] (IsEmptyTableCell): commented out. As used at
	present it could only return false anyway. 
	(several functions): Did something not so smart...added a const
	specifier on a lot of methods.
	
	* src/paragraph.C (BreakParagraph): removed the tmp->text.reserve
	and add a tmp->text.resize. The LyXParagraph constructor does the
	resize for us.
	(BreakParagraphConservative): ditto

	* src/support/path.h (Path): add a define so that the wrong usage
	"Path("/tmp") will be flagged as a compilation error:
	"`unnamed_Path' undeclared (first use this function)"

2000-01-12  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_FUNC_PUTENV_ARGTYPE): fix the macro,
	which was bogus for several reasons.

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanAux): fix the regular expression used to scan
	.aux files. 
	(runBibTeX): ditto.

	* autogen.sh: do not use "type -path" (what's that anyway?).

	* src/support/filetools.C (findtexfile): remove extraneous space
	which caused a kpsewhich warning (at least with kpathsea version
	3.0). 

2000-01-11  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/Makefile.am (noinst_LTLIBRARIES): use .la

	* src/insets/Makefile.am (noinst_LTLIBRARIES): use .la

	* src/Makefile.am (lyx_DEPENDENCIES): switch back to .la libs

2000-01-11  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/paragraph.C (BreakParagraph): do not reserve space on text
	if we don't need to (otherwise, if pos_end < pos, we end up
	reserving huge amounts of memory due to bad unsigned karma).
	(BreakParagraphConservative): ditto, although I have not seen
	evidence the bug can happen here.

	* src/lyxparagraph.h: add a using std::list.

2000-01-11  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/menus.C (MenuDocu): output an Alert if the documentation-file
	could not be found.

2000-01-11  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/vc-backend.C (doVCCommand): change to be static and take one
	more parameter: the path to chdir too be fore executing the command.
	(retrive): new function equiv to "co -r"

	* src/bufferlist.C (loadLyXFile): implement the missing parts if
	file_not_found_hook is true.

	* src/lyxvc.C (file_not_found_hook): implement file_not_found_hook.

	* src/support/filetools.C (IsFileWriteable): use FileInfo to check
	if a file is readwrite,readonly...anything else.

2000-01-10  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MakeLaTeXOutput): name change from MakeDVIOutput
	(CreatePostscript): name change from MenuRunDVIPS (or something)
	(PreviewPostscript): name change from MenuPreviewPS
	(PreviewDVI): name change from MenuPreviewDVI

	* lib/lyxrc.example: added \pdflatex_command, \pdf_mode,
	\view_pdf_command., \pdf_to_ps_command

	* lib/configure.m4: added search for PDF viewer, and search for
	PDF to PS converter. 
	(lyxrc.defaults output): add \pdflatex_command,
	\view_pdf_command and \pdf_to_ps_command.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuPreviewDVI): renamed from MenuPreview.

	* src/bufferlist.C (write): we don't use blocksize for anything so
	I removed it.

2000-01-10  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/block.h: disable operator T* (), since it causes
	problems with both compilers I tried. See comments in the file.

	* lib/reLyX/configure.in: do not define LYX_DIR. support flag
	--with-lyxname. 

	* lib/reLyX/reLyX.in: change LYX_DIR to pkgdatadir; change env.
	variable LYX_DIR_10x to LYX_DIR_11x.

	* src/Makefile.am: replace variable LYX_DIR with pkgdatadir.

	* INSTALL: document --with-lyxname.
	* NEWS: ditto.

	* configure.in: new configure flag --with-lyxname which allows to
	choose the name under which lyx is installed. Default is "lyx", of
	course. It used to be possible to do this with --program-suffix,
	but the later has in fact a different meaning for autoconf.

	* src/support/lstrings.h (lstrchr): reformat a bit.

	* src/lyxlex.h: include LIstream.h, for Sun CC this time.
	* src/mathed/math_defs.h: ditto.

2000-01-09  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyxrc.[Ch]: New tag and variable "\make_backup". Defaults to
	true, decides if we create a backup file or not when saving. New
	tag and variable \pdf_mode, defaults to false. New tag and
	variable \pdflatex_command, defaults to pdflatex. New tag and
	variable \view_pdf_command, defaults to xpdf. New tag and variable
	\pdf_to_ps_command, defaults to pdf2ps.

2000-01-08  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/bufferlist.C (close): don't call insetUnlock if the buffer
	does not have a BufferView.
	(unlockInset): ditto + don't access the_locking_inset if the
	buffer does not have a BufferView.

	* src/LyXView.C (KeyPressMask_raw_callback): add a XSync in
	certain circumstances so that we don't continue a keyboard
	operation long after the key was released. Try f.ex. to load a
	large document, press PageDown for some seconds and then release
	it. Before this change the document would contine to scroll for
	some time, with this change it stops imidiatly.

	* src/support/block.h: don't allocate more space than needed. As
	long as we don't try to write to the arr[x] in a array_type arr[x]
	it is perfectly ok. (if you write to it you might segfault).
	added operator value_type*() so that is possible to pass the array
	to functions expecting a C-pointer.

	* lib/Makefile.am (dist-hook): don't fail completely if unable to
	cvs.

	* intl/*: updated to gettext 0.10.35, tried to add our own
	required modifications. Please verify.

	* po/*: updated to gettext 0.10.35, tried to add our own required
	modifications. Please verify.
	
	* src/support/lstrings.C (tostr): go at fixing the problem with
	cxx and stringstream. When stringstream is used return
	oss.str().c_str() so that problems with lyxstring and basic_string
	are avoided. Note that the best solution would be for cxx to use
	basic_string all the way, but it is not conformant yet. (it seems)

	* src/lyx_cb.C + other files: moved several global functions to
	class BufferView, some have been moved to BufferView.[Ch] others
	are still located in lyx_cb.C. Code changes because of this. (part
	of "get rid of current_view project".)

	* src/buffer.C + other files: moved several Buffer functions to
	class BufferView, the functions are still present in buffer.C.
	Code changes because of this.

	* config/lcmessage.m4: updated to most recent. used when creating
	acinclude.m4.

	* config/progtest.m4: updated to most recent. used when creating
	acinclude.m4.
	
	* config/gettext.m4: updated to most recent. applied patch for
	tmplinguas.

	* config/gettext.m4.patch: new file that shows what changes we
	have done to the local copy of gettext.m4.

	* config/libtool.m4: new file, used in creation of acinclude.m4

	* config/lyxinclude.m4: new file, this is the lyx created m4
	macros, used in making acinclude.m4.
	
	* autogen.sh: GNU m4 discovered as a separate task not as part of
	the lib/configure creation. 
	Generate acinlucde from files in config. Actually cat
	lyxinclude.m4, libtool.m4 and gettext.m4 together. This makes it
	easier to upgrade .m4 files that really are external.

	* src/Spacing.h: moved using std::istringstream to right after
	<sstream>. This should fix the problem seen with some compilers.

2000-01-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyx_cb.C: began some work to remove the dependency a lot of
	functions have on BufferView::text, even if not really needed.
	(GetCurrentTextClass): removed this func, it only hid the
	current_view. 

	* src/Makefile.am (lyx_DEPENDENCIES): use support/libsupport.la I
	forgot this in last commit.

	* src/Bullet.C (bulletEntry): use static char const *[] for the
	tables, becuase of this the return arg had to change to string.
	(bulletSize): ditto
	(~Bullet): removed unneeded destructor

	* src/BufferView.C (beforeChange): moved from lyx_cb.C
	(insetSleep): moved from Buffer
	(insetWakeup): moved from Buffer
	(insetUnlock): moved from Buffer

	* buffer.[Ch], BufferView.[Ch] + others: moved the_locking_inset
	from Buffer to BufferView.
	
	* acinclude.m4: include libtool.m4 from libtool 1.3.4.

	* config/ltmain.sh: updated to version 1.3.4 of libtool

	* config/ltconfig: updated to version 1.3.4 of libtool

2000-01-06  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>


	* src/buffer.C (pop_tag): fix a dubious for() loop initialization.
	Did I get that right?

	* src/lyxlex.h: add a "using" directive or two.
	* src/Spacing.h: ditto.
	* src/insets/figinset.C: ditto.
	* src/support/filetools.C: ditto.
	* src/support/lstrings.C: ditto.
	* src/BufferView.C: ditto.
	* src/bufferlist.C: ditto.
	* src/lyx_cb.C: ditto.
	* src/lyxlex.C: ditto.

	* NEWS: add some changes for 1.1.4.
	
2000-01-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/BufferView.C: first go at a TextCache to speed up switching
	between documents.

	* lib/examples/ItemizeBullets.lyx: update from Tino Meinen. 
	* lib/examples/nl_voorbeeld_ruw.lyx: ditto.
	* lib/examples/nl_voorbeeld_verlyxt.lyx: ditto.
	* lib/examples/nl_opsommingstekens.lyx: new translation from Tino
	Meinen.
	
	* src/mathed/math_defs.h (MathedRowSt): make sure that all
	members of the struct are correctly initialized to 0 (detected by
	purify) 
	* src/lyxrc.C (LyXRC): ditto for print_adapt_output.
	* src/insets/figinset.C (InsetFig): ditto for pswid and pshgh.

	* src/insets/figinset.C (sigchldchecker): use "delete" to free a
	pidwait, since it was allocated with "new". This was potentially
	very bad. Thanks to Michael Schmitt for running purify for us.


2000-01-04  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyx_gui_misc.C: add a 'using std::make_pair;' statement.

	src/mathed/formula.C (LocalDispatch): askForText changes

	* src/lyx_gui_misc.[Ch] (askForText): now returns a bool also so we 
	know when a user has cancelled input. Fixes annoying problems with
	inserting labels and version control.

1999-12-29  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lstrings.C (tostr): rewritten to use strstream and

	(next): ditto
	(nextToken): ditto

	* src/buffer.C (Dispatch): remove an extraneous break statement.

	* src/support/filetools.C (QuoteName): change to do simple
	'quoting'. More work is necessary. Also changed to do nothing
	under emx (needs fix too).

	needs char * as argument (because Solaris 7 declares it like
	that). 

	* acconfig.h: remove placeholder for STL_STRING_FWD_H_LOCATION;
	remove definition of BZERO.

1999-12-24  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* configure.in: add call to LYX_REGEX 

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_REGEX): checks if we need to use the included
	regex or not. Uses a a AM_CONDITIONAL to decide what to compile.

	instead of the hardcoded comma.

	* src/insets/insetbib.C (getKeys): make sure that there are not
	leading blanks in bibtex keys. Normal latex does not care, but
	harvard.sty seems to dislike blanks at the beginning of citation
	keys. In particular, the retturn value of the function is

	* INSTALL: make it clear that libstdc++ is needed and that gcc
	2.7.x probably does not work.

	to avoid user name, date and copyright.

1999-12-21  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/table.C (Read): Now read bogus row format informations
		if the format is < 5 so that afterwards the table can
		be read by lyx but without any format-info. Fixed the
		crash we experienced when not doing this.

1999-12-21  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/text2.C (RedoHeightOfParagraph): rename arg cursor -> cur

	* src/support/lstrings.h: return type of countChar changed to
	unsigned char.

	* src/support/lstrings.C (countChar): use HAVE_STD_COUNT to choose
	what version of this func to use. Also made to return unsigned int.

	* configure.in: call LYX_STD_COUNT 

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_STD_COUNT): new function checks for a standard
	conforming std::count. 

1999-12-20  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/mathed/math_draw.C (Draw, Metrics): fix a bug where a prime
	and a subscript would give bad display (patch from Dekel Tsur
	<dekel@math.tau.ac.il>). 

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.h: make sure ACCENT_TYPES is public. 

	* src/spellchecker.C (create_ispell_pipe): use a const_cast to
	please sun CC.

	* src/chset.h: add a few 'using' directives

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): check that LFUN_UNKNOWN_ACTION is not
	triggered when no buffer is active

	* src/layout.C: removed `break' after `return' in switch(), since
	it is unreachable.

	* src/lyx_main.C (init): make sure LyX can be ran in place even
	when libtool has done its magic with shared libraries. Fix the
	test for the case when the system directory has not been found.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuMakeLaTeX): make sure to keep the full path
	name for the latex file.
	(MenuMakeHTML): ditto

	* src/buffer.h: add an optional boolean argument, which is passed
	to ChangeExtension.

1999-12-20  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* lib/templates/IEEEtran.lyx: small correction and update.

	* configure.in: Attempted to use LYX_PATH_HEADER

 	* src/stl_string_fwd.h: Don't need HAVE_STL_STRING_FWD_H anymore

	* acconfig.h, acinclude.m4 (LYX_STL_STRING_FWD): totally revised after
 	input from JMarc.  Now use preprocessor to find the header.
 	Also stopped making HAVE_STL_STRING_FWD_H and extended the comments.
	(LYX_PATH_HEADER): My, so far, failed attempt to generalize
 	LYX_STL_STRING_FWD.  See comments in file.	

1999-12-19  Asger Alstrup Nielsen  <alstrup@diku.dk>

	* The global MiniBuffer * minibuffer variable is dead.
	
	* The global FD_form_main * fd_form_main variable is dead.

1999-12-17  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/toolbar.C (set): condition #warning on WITH_WARNINGS

	* src/table.h: add the LOstream.h header
	* src/debug.h: ditto
	
	* src/LyXAction.h: change the explaination of the ReadOnly
	attribute: is indicates that the function _can_ be used.

	* src/LyXAction.C (init): find-replace _can_ be used in read-only
	mode. 

1999-12-16  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxfont.C (ascent): Make sure that char is _always_ used as
	unsigned. 
	(descent): ditto
	(lbearing): ditto
	(rbearing): ditto

	* src/paragraph.C (GetWord): assert on pos>=0
	(GetChar): ditto
	
	* src/support/lyxstring.C: condition the use of an invariant on
	ENABLE_ASSERTIONS 
	* src/support/lyxstring.h: ditto

	* src/Bullet.[Ch]: replace DEBUG_AS_DEFAULT by ENABLE_ASSERTIONS.
	Use LAssert.h instead of plain assert().

	* src/support/lstrings.h: add LAssert.h, in case it is needed.

	* src/lyxfunc.C: do not include LAssert.h, it is not used.
	* src/support/filetools.C: ditto

	* src/support/LAssert.h: make Assert a no-op if ENABLE_ASSERTIONS
	is not defined. 

	* INSTALL: document the new configure flags
	
	* configure.in: suppress --with-debug; add --enable-assertions

	* acinclude.m4: various changes in alignment of help strings.

1999-12-16  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/kbmap.C: commented out the use of the hash map in kb_map,
	beginning of movement to a stl::container. 

	* several files: removed code that was not in effect when
	MOVE_TEXT was defined.
	
	* lib/kbd/iso8859-1.cdef: removed bogus backslashes. Backslashes
	for escaping should not be used. We can discuss if the string
	should be enclosed in f.ex. [] instead of "".

	* src/trans_mgr.C (insert): use the new returned value from
	encodeString to get deadkeys and keymaps done correctly.

	* src/chset.C (encodeString): changed to return a pair, to tell
	what to use if we know the string.

	* src/lyxscreen.h (fillArc): new function.

	* src/FontInfo.C (resize): rewritten to use more std::string like
	structore, especially string::replace.

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (Draw): use fillArc for the
	approp. accents.

	* configure.in (chmod +x some scripts): remove config/gcc-hack 

1999-12-15  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/buffer.C (writeFile): change once again the top comment in a
	.lyx file to point to www.lyx.org and to use LYX_DOCVERSION
	instead of an hardcoded version number.
	(makeDocBookFile): ditto

	* src/version.h: add new define LYX_DOCVERSION

	* po/de.po: update from Pit Sütterlin
	* lib/bind/de_menus.bind: ditto.
	
	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): call MenuExport()
	* src/buffer.C (Dispatch): ditto

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuMakeHTML): new function, moved from
	LyXFunc::Dispatch().
	(MenuExport): new function, moved from
	LyXFunc::Dispatch().

	* src/trans_mgr.C (insert): small cleanup
	* src/chset.C (loadFile): ditto

	* lib/kbd/iso8859-1.cdef: add missing backslashes

1999-12-15  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (Lbearing): new function, used to
	help with placing the manually drawn accents better.
	(Rbearing): ditto
	(Draw): x2 and hg changed to float to minimize rounding errors and
	help place the accents better.

	* src/lyxfont.C (ascent): fixed faulty static_cast, casting from
	unsigned short to char is just wrong...cast the char to unsigned
	char instead so that the two values can compare sanely. This
	should also make the display of insetlatexaccents better and
	perhaps also some other insets.
	(descent): ditto
	(lbearing): new function
	(rbearing): ditto

1999-12-15  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/stl_string_fwd.h, src/Makefile.am (lyx_SOURCES):  added new
	header that provides a wrapper around the very annoying SGI STL header
 	of the same name.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C, src/LString.h:
	removed old SGI-STL-compatability attempts.

	* configure.in: Use LYX_STL_STRING_FWD.

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_STL_STRING_FWD), acconfig.h: Test if 
	stl_string_fwd.h is around and try to determine it's location.
  	Major improvement over previous SGI STL 3.2 compatability.
	Three small problems remain with this function due to my zero
	knowledge of autoconf.  JMarc and lgb see the comments in the code.

1999-12-14  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/broken_const.h, config/hack-gcc, config/README: removed
	
	* configure.in: remove --with-gcc-hack option; do not call
	LYX_CXX_STL_STACK 

	* INSTALL: remove documentation of --with-broken-const and
	--with-gcc-hack
	
	* acconfig.h: remove all trace of BROKEN_CONST define

	* src/buffer.C (makeDocBookFile): update version number in output
	file. 
	(SimpleDocBookOnePar): fix an assert when trying to a character
	access beyond string length
	[Patch from Jose']

1999-12-13  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* po/de.po: fix the Export menu

	* lyx.man: update the description of -dbg

	* src/lyx_main.C (setDebuggingLevel): call Debug::showLevel()
	(commandLineHelp): updated
	(easyParse): show list of available debug levels if -dbg is passed
	without argument.

	* src/Makefile.am: add debug.C

	* src/debug.h: moved some code to debug.C

	* src/debug.C: new file. Contains code to set and show debug
	level. 

	* src/layout.C: remove 'break' after 'continue' in switch
	statements, since these cannot be reached.

1999-12-13  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/math_hash.C (math_hash): renamed from hash(), name clash.
 	(in_word_set): hash() -> math_hash()

	* src/LString.h: Used USING_EXCEPTIONS in SGI STL-3.2 support 

	* acconfig.h: Added a test for whether we are using exceptions in the
	current compilation run. If so USING_EXCEPTIONS is defined.

	* config.in: Check for existance of stl_string_fwd.h
	* src/LString.h: If compiling --with-included-string and SGI's
	STL version 3.2 is present (see above test) we need to block their
	forward declaration of string and supply a __get_c_string().
	However, it turns out this is only necessary if compiling with
	exceptions enabled so I've a bit more to add yet.

	* src/insets/figinset.[Ch], src/insets/insetinclude.C,
	  src/insets/insetloa.C, src/layout.h, src/lyxparagraph.h,
          src/support/LRegex.h, src/undo.h:
	Shuffle the order of the included files a little to ensure that
	LString.h gets included before anything that includes stl_string_fwd.h

	*  src/support/lyxstring.C: We need to #include LString.h instead of
	lyxstring.h to get the necessary definition of __get_c_string.
	(__get_c_string): New function.  This is defined static just like SGI's
	although why they need to do this I'm not sure.  Perhaps it should be
	in lstrings.C instead.

	* lib/templates/IEEEtran.lyx:  New template file.

1999-12-12  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>
	
	* Makefile.in.in (MKINSTALLDIRS): use $(srcdir)/@MKINSTALLDIRS@
	* intl/Makefile.in (MKINSTALLDIRS):  ditto

	* src/LyXAction.C (init): changed to hold the LFUN data in a
	automatic array in stead of in callso to newFunc, this speeds up
	compilation a lot. Also all the memory used by the array is
	returned when the init is completed.

	* a lot of files: compiled with -Wold-style-cast, changed most of
	the reported offenders to C++ style casts. Did not change the
	offenders in C files. 

	* src/trans.h (Match): change argument type to unsigned int.

	* src/support/DebugStream.C: fix some types on the streambufs so
	that it works on a conforming implementation.

1999-12-10  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/examples/example_{raw,lyxified}.lyx: fix embarassing sentence.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C: remove the inline added earlier since
	they cause a bunch of unsatisfied symbols when linking with dec
	cxx. Cxx likes to have the body of inlines at the place where they
	are declared.

	* src/trans.C (AddDeadkey): add an 'unsigned char' cast to avoid
	accessing negative bounds in array. This fixes the crash when
	inserting accented characters.
	* src/trans.h (Match): ditto

	* src/buffer.C (Dispatch): since this is a void, it should not try
	to return anything...

1999-12-10  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/buffer.h: removed the two friends from Buffer. Some changes
	because of this. Buffer::getFileName and Buffer::setFileName
	renamed to Buffer::fileName() and Buffer::fileName(...).

1999-12-09  Lars Gullik Bjønnes <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* buffer.[Ch], BufferView.[Ch] + other files: Moved Buffer::text
	and Buffer::update(short) to BufferView. This move is currently
	controlled by a define MOVE_TEXT, this will be removed when all
	shows to be ok. This move paves the way for better separation
	between buffer contents and buffer view. One side effect is that
	the BufferView needs a rebreak when swiching buffers, if we want
	to avoid this we can add a cache that holds pointers to LyXText's
	that is not currently in use. 

	* buffer.[Ch], lyx_main.C: small changes to the "-export" patch by
	André Pönitz. 

1999-11-18  André Pönitz <poenitz@mathematik.tu-chemnitz.de>

	* buffer.[Ch]: Dispatch() - new dispatcher on the buffer level

	* lyx_main.C: new command line option -x (or --execute) and
	  -e (or --export). Now direct conversion from .lyx to .tex
	  (.dvi, .ps, ...) is possible  ('lyx file.lyx --export latex')
	  Unfortunately, X is still needed and the GUI pops up during the
	  process...

1999-12-07  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/Spacing.C: add a using directive to bring stream stuff into
	normal namespace.
	* src/paragraph.C: ditto
	* src/buffer.C: ditto

	* NEWS: updated a bit the new features of 1.1.3 (took a few things
	from Lars' announcement).

	* lib/examples/nl_voorbeeld_{ruw,verlyxt}.lyx: new tutorial
	example files from Tino Meinen.
	
1999-12-06  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/LaTeX.C (runBibTeX): fix typo in accessing submatch pair.

1999-12-07  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C: added a lot of inline for no good
	reason
	
	* src/lyxfont.[Ch]: removed latexWriteStartChanges, and
	latexWriteEndChanges, they were not used.
	
	* src/layout.h (operator<<): output operator for PageSides

	* src/mathed/math_iter.C (my_memcpy): slightly changed.

	* some example files: loaded in LyX 1.0.4 and saved again to update
	certain constructs (table format) 

	* a lot of files: did the change to use fstream/iostream for all
	writing of files. Done with a close look at Andre Poenitz's patch.

	* some files: whitespace changes.
	
1999-12-06  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/mathed/math_iter.C (my_memcpy): new function. Since the
	built-in memcpy() is broken on egcs and gcc 2.95 for alpha
	architecture, we provide our own. It is used unconditionnally, but
	I do not think this is a performance problem. Thanks to Angus
	Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk> for the code (and again to Michal
	Jaegermann <michal@ellpspace.math.ualberta.ca> for finding it the
	first time).
	(GetInset): use my_memcpy.
	(Insert): ditto
	(Copy): ditto

	* lib/chkconfig.ltx: some cleanup of the latex code. I am not sure
	it is easier to understand, but it uses less TeX-only constructs now.

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_SEARCH_PROG): make it work when the PATH
	elements contain spaces

	* lib/configure: regenerated
	
	* lib/configure.m4 (SEARCH_PROG): make it work when the PATH
	elements contain spaces; display the list of programs that are
	tried.

	* autogen.sh: make sure lib/configure is executable

	* lib/examples/*: rename the tutorial examples to begin with the
	two-letters language code.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (getStatus): do not query current font if no
	buffer exists.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (RunScript): use QuoteName
	(MenuRunDvips): ditto
	(PrintApplyCB): ditto

	* src/support/filetools.[Ch] (QuoteName): new function. Add quotes
	around argument, so that it works well with the current shell.
	Does not work properly with OS/2 shells currently.

	* src/LaTeXLog.C (ShowLatexLog): use Buffer::getLatexName
	* src/LyXSendto.C (SendtoApplyCB): ditto
	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): ditto
	* src/buffer.C (runLaTeX): ditto
	(runLiterate): ditto
	(buildProgram): ditto
	(runChktex): ditto
	* src/lyx_cb.C (RunScript): ditto
	(MenuMakeLaTeX): ditto
	
	* src/buffer.h (getLatexName): new method 

	* src/support/filetools.C (MakeLatexName): renamed from SpaceLess

1999-12-02  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* images/sqrt.xpm: change name of the sqrt icon to sqrt_xpm.
	* src/mathed/math_panel.C (mathed_get_pixmap_from_icon): ditto
	(create_math_panel): ditto

	* src/lyxfunc.C (getStatus): re-activate the code which gets
	current font and cursor; add test for export to html.

	* src/lyxrc.C (read): remove unreachable break statements; add a
	few "using".

	* src/bmtable.C (fl_set_bmtable_data): add a const_cast.
	
1999-12-01  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/formula.C (LocalDispatch): fix small whitspace bug
	introduced by faulty regex.
	* src/buffer.C: ditto
	* src/lastfiles.C: ditto
	* src/paragraph.C: ditto
	* src/table.C: ditto
	* src/vspace.C: ditto
	* src/insets/figinset.C: ditto
	Note: most of these is absolutely harmless, except the one in
	src/mathed formula.C.

1999-11-30  Kayvan A. Sylvan  <kayvan@satyr.sylvan.com>

	* src/ImportNoweb.C (documentclass): fixed bounds for substr
	  operation, yielding correct results for the reLyX command.

1999-12-01  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/filetools.C (ExpandPath): removed an over eager
	Assert.
	(ReplaceEnvironmentPath): ditto

	* src/toolbar.C (BubbleTimerCB): use C++ style casts. This clearly
	shows that we are doing something fishy in our code...
	(BubblePost): ditto
	(ToolbarCB): ditto

	* src/lyxrc.C (read): use a double switch trick to get more help
	from the compiler. (the same trick is used in layout.C)
	(write): new function. opens a ofstream and pass that to output
	(output): new function, takes a ostream and writes the lyxrc
	elemts to it. uses a dummy switch to make sure no elements are
	forgotten. 

	* src/lyxlex.h: added a struct pushpophelper for use in functions
	with more than one exit point.

	* src/lyxlex.[Ch] (GetInteger): made it const
	(GetFloat): ditto
	(GetBool): ditto

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): added case for LFUN_SAVEPREFERENCES

	* src/layout.[hC] : LayoutTags splitted into several enums, new
	methods created, better error handling cleaner use of lyxlex. Read
	the diff.

	* src/bmtable.[Ch]: change some member prototypes because of the
	image const changes. 

	* commandtags.h, src/LyXAction.C (init): new function:
	"preferences-save", saves the lyxrc entries into .lyx/preferences.
	This file is not read automatically but you can add \input
	preferences to your lyxrc if you want to. We need to discuss how
	to handle this. 

	* src/LaTeX.C (runBibTeX): use regex to match for the needed lines
	in .aux, also remove .bib and .bst files from dependencies when
	running bibtex.

	* src/BufferView.C, src/LyXView.C: add const_cast several places
	because of changes to images.

	* lib/images/*: same change as for images/*
	
	* lib/lyxrc.example: Default for accept_compound is false not no.

	* images/*: changed to be const, however I have som misgivings
	about this change so it might be changed back.

1999-11-26  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/configure, po/POTFILES.in: regenerated

	* autogen.sh: autogenerate lib/configure from lib/configure.m4

	* config/lib_configure.m4: removed
	
	* lib/configure.m4: new file (was config/lib_configure.m4)

	* configure.in: do not test for rtti, since we do not use it.
	
1999-11-26  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (lyxstring::Srep): Changed to use a
	doubling of allocated space scheme. This makes it faster for large
	strings end to use less memory for small strings. xtra rememoved. 

	* src/insets/figinset.C (waitalarm): commented out.
	(GhostscriptMsg): use static_cast
	(GhostscriptMsg): use new instead of malloc to allocate memory for
	cmap. also delete the memory after use.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (SetXtermCursor): made cursor_undefined a bool

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanAux): new method. Scans the .aux file and looks
	for changes in bibtex database or style.
	(runBibTeX): remove all .bib and .bst files from dep before we
	begin. 
	(run): use scanAuc in when dep file already exist.

	* src/DepTable.C (remove_files_with_extension): new method
	(exist): new method

	* src/DepTable.[Ch]: made many of the methods const. 

1999-11-25  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/bufferparams.C: make sure that the default textclass is
	"article". It used to be the first one by description order, but
	now the first one is "docbook".

	* src/lyx_main.C (setDebuggingLevel): change type of argument to
	string; call Debug::value.
	(easyParse): pass complete argument to setDebuggingLevel().

	* src/debug.h (value): fix the code that parses debug levels.

	* src/debug.h: add new debug type ACTION, reserved for LyXAction
	class.  

	* src/LyXAction.C: use Debug::ACTION as debug channel.

	* src/lyxlookup.C: make the debug statements go to Debug::KEY.

	* NEWS: updated for the future 1.1.3 release.

	* src/mathed/symbol_def.h: swap the definitions of \varepsilon and
	\epsilon. Now \epsilon shows as red text, and \varepsilon shows as
	it should. This is of course a controversial change (since many
	people will find that their lyx workscreen is suddenly full of
	red), but done for the sake of correctness.

	* src/mathed/formulamacro.h, src/mathed/math_macro.[Ch],
	  src/mathed/math_root.[Ch] (Clone): return a MathedInset*  

	* src/insets/inseterror.h, src/insets/inseturl.h,
	  src/insets/insetinfo.h, src/insets/figinset.h,
	  src/mathed/formulamacro.h, src/mathed/math_macro.h
	  (EditMessage): add a missing const and add _() to make sure that
	translation happens

	* src/ImportNoweb.C, src/LyXAction.h, src/insets/figinset.C,
	  src/insets/insetbib.C, src/support/filetools.C: add `using'
	directives for cxx.  

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): make sure nothing bad happens when
	doing 'Insert index of last word' at the beginning of a paragraph.

1999-11-24  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* several files: white-space changes.

	* src/mathed/formula.C: removed IsAlpha and IsDigit

	* src/insets/insetbib.C (getKeys): use findtexfile to look for the
	.bib file. use a ifstream instead of FilePtr when parsing the .bib
	file for keys.

	* src/insets/figinset.C (GetPSSizes): don't break when
	"EndComments" is seen. But break when a boundingbox is read.

	* all classes inherited from Inset: return value of Clone
	changed back to Inset *.

	* all classes inherited form MathInset: return value of Clone
	changed back to MathedInset *.
	
	* src/insets/figinset.C (runqueue): use a ofstream to output the
	gs/ps file. Might need some setpresicion or setw. However I can
	see no problem with the current code.
	(runqueue): use sleep instead of the alarm/signal code. I just
	can't see the difference.

	* src/paragraph.C (LyXParagraph): reserve space in the new
	paragraph and resize the inserted paragraph to just fit.

	* src/lyxfunc.h (operator|=): added operator for func_status.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (MenuNew): use FileInfo instead of FilePtr to
	check for readable file.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuMakeLaTeX): use FileInfo instead of FilePtr to
	check for readable file.
	(MenuMakeLinuxDoc): ditto
	(MenuMakeDocBook): ditto
	(MenuMakeAscii): ditto
	(InsertAsciiFile): split the test for openable and readable

	* src/bmtable.C (draw_bitmaptable): use
	fl_state[fl_get_vclass()].depth instead of DefualtScreen.

	* src/LaTeX.C, src/support/filetools.[Ch]: moved do_popen and
	findtexfile from LaTeX to filetools.
	
	* src/ImportNoweb.C (documentclass): rewrote to use ifstream
	instead of FilePtr. Needs to be verified by a literate user.

1999-11-23  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/mathed/formula.[Ch] (GetCursorPos): add a missing 'const'.
	(EditMessage): likewise.

	* src/paragraph.C (SimpleTeXSpecialChars): output ~ and ^

	* acinclude.m4 (VERSION): new rules for when a version is
	development, added also a variable for prerelease.
	(warnings): we set with_warnings=yes for prereleases
	(lyx_opt): prereleases compile with same optimization as development 
	(CXXFLAGS): only use pedantic if we are a development version 

	* src/BufferView.C (restorePosition): don't do anything if the
	backstack is empty.

	* src/BackStack.h: added member empty, use this to test if there
	is anything to pop...

1999-10-25  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* forms/form_url.fd +
	* src/insets/form_url.[Ch]: added because it's cleaner and easier
	to modify IMO.

	* src/insets/Makefile.am: added files form_url.[Ch]
	
1999-10-25  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* INSTALL: it is now possible to compile LyX with digital C++ 6.1
	(and presumably 6.2).

	* src/{BufferView,LyXView,combox,filedlg,intl,lyxserver,lyxvc,
	menus,minibuffer,toolbar}.{C,h}: added C_xxx wrappers around
	remaining static member callbacks. 

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): Use _() instead of N_() fot minibuffer
	messages. 

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: declare struct Srep as friend of
	lyxstring, since DEC cxx complains otherwise.

1999-10-24  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

1999-10-24  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/LaTeX.C (run): made run_bibtex also depend on files with
	extension ".bst"
	(runBibTeX): added scans for "\\bibstyle", now also ".bst" files
	are put into the dependency file.

	commented out a long time

	* src/lyxfunc.C (processKeyEvent): removed some very old commented
	out code + a warning.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: comment out the three private
	operators, when compiling with string ansi conforming compilers
	they make problems.

	* src/mathed/math_symbols.C (AddBitmap): change 6th arg to be
	unsigned char *.
	(pixmapFromBitmapData): change type of bdata to be unsigned char *

	to XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData
	(fl_set_bmtable_data): change the last argument to be unsigned
	char *
	(fl_set_bmtable_file): change bdata to unsinged char *, change bw

	needed. 
	(LYX_CXX_CHEADERS): added <clocale> to the test. 

1999-10-23  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyx_cb.C (addNewlineAndDepth): changed to use string::append.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (append): fixed something that must be a
	bug, rep->assign was used instead of rep->append.

	* src/support/Makefile.am (libsupport_a_SOURCES): added LIstream.h
	and LOstream.h

	* src/lyxfunc.C (processKeyEvent): removed faulty line that made
	lyx insert double chars. Fix spotted by Kayvan.

1999-10-23  Asger Alstrup Nielsen  <alstrup@alstrup.galaxy.dk>

	* Fixed the tth support. I messed up with the Emacs patch apply feature
	and omitted the changes in lyxrc.C.

1999-10-22  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/figinset.C (CallbackFig): Just changed the defines a bit.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuInsertRef) + 
	* src/lyx_gui.C (create_forms): Inserted fl_set_form_minsize so that
	the form cannot be resized under it limits (fixes a segfault)
	
	* src/lyx.C (create_form_form_ref) +
	* forms/lyx.fd: Changed Gravity on name input field so that it is
 	resized correctly.

1999-10-22  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* configure.in: use LYX_CXX_STL_MODERN_STREAMS; check for headers
	<ostream> and <istream>.
	
	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_STL_MODERN_STREAMS): new test. Checks
	whether <fstream> provides the latest standard features, or if we
	have an oldstyle library (like in egcs).
	(LYX_CXX_STL_STRING): fix the test.

	* src/support/DebugStream.{C,h}: use L{I,O}stream.h and condition the
	code on MODERN_STL_STREAM.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: use L{I,O}stream.h.

	* src/support/L{I,O}stream.h: new files, designed to setup
	correctly streams for our use
	  - includes the right header depending on STL capabilities
	  - puts std::ostream and std::endl (for LOStream.h) or
	  std::istream (LIStream.h) in toplevel namespace.

1999-10-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/LaTeX.C (run): added a check in 0 sumchange so that if it
	was a bib file that had been changed we ensure that bibtex is run.
	(runBibTeX): enhanced to extract the names of the bib files and
	getting their absolute path and enter them into the dep file.
	(findtexfile): static func that is used to look for tex-files,
	checks for absolute patchs and tries also with kpsewhich.
	Alternative ways of finding the correct files are wanted. Will
	probably be moved.
	(do_popen): function that runs a command using popen and returns
	the whole output of that command in a string. Should be moved to
	somewhere else.

	* src/DepTable.[Ch] (extchanged): new function that returns true if a
	file with extension ext has changed.

	* src/insets/figinset.C: added ifdef guards around the fl_free
	code that jug commented out. Now it is commented out when
	compiling with XForms == 0.89.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C: moved the definition of lyxstring::Srep
	to lyxstring.C, and only keep a forward declaration in
	lyxstring.h. Simplifies the header file a bit and should help a
	bit on compile time too. Also changes to Srep will not mandate a
	recompile of code just using string.
	(~lyxstring): definition moved here since it uses srep.
	(size): definition moved here since it uses srep.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: removed a couple of "inline" that should
	not be there.

1999-10-21  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/insets/inseturl.C (C_InsetUrl_CloseUrlCB): forgot to pass
	the 'ob' argument.

1999-10-21  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/table.C (SetPWidth): Just a small fix so the alignment is not
	set to left if I just remove the width entry (or it is empty).

	* src/text2.C (SetCursorIntern): Fixed a bug calculating to use wrong
	paragraph when having dummy paragraphs.

1999-10-20  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/figinset.C: just commented some fl_free_form calls
	and added warnings so that this calls should be activated later
	again. This avoids for now a segfault, but we have a memory leak!

	* src/lyxfunc.C (processKeyEvent) (Dispatch): changed
 	'const char * argument' to 'string argument', this should
	fix some Asserts() in lyxstring.C.

	* src/lyxfunc.h: Removed the function argAsString(const char *)
	as it is not used anymore.

1999-10-20  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (getline): reads now _all_ chars. uses
	get instead of >>

	* src/Literate.h: some funcs moved from public to private to make
	interface clearer. Unneeded args removed.

	* src/Literate.C (scanLiterateLogFile): rewritten to use iostream
	instead of lyxlex.
	(scanBuildLogFile): ditto

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanLogFile): merged LaTeX Error handling into
	normal TeX Error. Still room for improvement.

	* src/LaTeX.[Ch]: removed scanError. Wrong place and not needed.

	* src/buffer.C (insertErrors): changes to make the error
	desctription show properly.

	* src/LaTeX.C (deplog): removed the test for file in lyx doc dir.
	could never happen

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (helper): changed to use
	sizeof(object->rep->ref).
	(operator>>): changed to use a pointer instead.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: changed const reference & to value_type
	const & lets see if that helps.

1999-10-19  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* Makefile.am (rpmdist): fixed to have non static package and
	verison.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C: removed the compilation guards

	* src/vspace.C (nextToken): use i + 1  instead of ++i. Maks things
	a bit clearer.

	* src/support/Makefile.am (LYXSTRING): bruker USE_LYXSTRING for
	conditional compile of lyxstring.Ch

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_STL_STRING): new and improved, still a
	stupid check, but it is a lot better than the bastring hack. 
	(LYX_CXX_STL_STRING): bruker nå AM_CONDITIONAL(USE_LYXSTRING  

	* several files: changed string::erase into string::clear. Not
	really needed.
	
	* src/chset.C (encodeString): use a char temporary instead

	* src/table.C (TexEndOfCell): added tostr around
	column_of_cell(fcell+i)+1 and around right_column_of_cell(fcell+i)+1
	(TexEndOfCell): ditto
	(TexEndOfCell): ditto
	(TexEndOfCell): ditto
	(DocBookEndOfCell): ditto
	(DocBookEndOfCell): ditto
	(DocBookEndOfCell): ditto
	(DocBookEndOfCell): ditto

	* src/paragraph.C (TeXEnvironment): added tostr around foot_count -1

	* src/lyxfr1.C (SearchReplaceAllCB): added tostr around replace_count

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuRunLaTeX): added tostr around ret
	(MenuBuildProg): added tostr around ret
	(MenuRunChktex): added tostr around ret
	(DocumentApplyCB): added tostr around ret

	* src/chset.C (encodeString): added tostr around t->ic

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): added tostr around secnumdepth
	(makeLaTeXFile): added tostr around tocdepth
	(makeLaTeXFile): added tostr around ftcound - 1

	* src/insets/insetbib.C (setCounter): added tostr around counter.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: added an operator+=(int) to catch more
	mistakes. 

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (lyxstring): We DON'T allow NULL pointers.
	(lyxstring): We DON'T allow NULL pointers.

1999-10-19  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/mathed/math_macro.C (MathMacroArgument::Write,
	MathMacroTemplate::WriteDef): add tostr() around macro arg numbers
	when writing them out.

	* src/LString.C: remove, since it is not used anymore.
	
	* src/support/lyxstring.C: condition the content to
	USE_INCLUDED_STRING macro.

	* src/mathed/math_symbols.C, src/support/lstrings.C,
	src/support/lyxstring.C: add `using' directive to specify what
	we need in <algorithm>. I do not think that we need to
	conditionalize this, but any thought is appreciated.

	* many files: change all callback functions to "C" linkage
	functions to please strict C++ compilers like DEC cxx 6.1 in mode
	strict_ansi. Those who were static are now global. 
  	    The case of callbacks which are static class members is
	trickier, since we have to make C wrappers around them (see
	InsetError, InsetInfo and InsetUrl). The same holds for friends. I
	did not finish this yet, since it defeats the purpose of
	encapsulation, and I am not sure what the best route is.

1999-10-19  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (lyxstring): we permit to have a null
	pointer as assignment value and just don't assign it.

	* src/vspace.C (nextToken): corrected this function substituting
	find_first(_not)_of with find_last_of.

	* src/TableLayout.C (UpdateLayoutTable) (TableOptionsCB)
 		(TableOptCloseCB) (TableSpeCloseCB):
	inserted fl_set_focus call for problem with fl_hide_form() in
 	xforms-0.89.

1999-10-19  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyx_cb.C (LayoutsCB): fix bug where int was added to a
	string. 

1999-10-18  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxrc.C (Read): RC_PRINTEXSTRAOPTIONS now uses
	LyXLex::next() and not eatline() to get its argument.

1999-10-17  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/DepTable.[Ch]: rewritten to store the dependencies in a map
	instead, use fstreams for io of the depfile, removed unneeded
	functions and variables. 

	* src/LaTeX.[Ch] (class TeXErrors): rewrote to store the errors in a
	vector instead, removed all functions and variables that is not in
	use.

1999-10-16  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/buffer.C (insertErrors): use new interface to TeXError

	* Makefile.am (rpmdist): added a rpmdist target

	* lib/reLyX/Makefile.am: added RelyxFigure.pm and Verbatim.pm as
	per Kayvan's instructions.

1999-10-15  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/Makefile.am: add a definition for localedir, so that locales
	are found after installation (Kayvan)

1999-10-14  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* development/.cvsignore: new file.

1999-10-14  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_CHEADERS): New macro. Checks whether the
	C++ compiler provides wrappers for C headers and use our alternate
	version otherwise.

	* configure.in: use LYX_CXX_CHEADERS.

	* src/cheader/: new directory, populated with cname headers from
	libstdc++-2.8.1. They are a bit old, but probably good enough for
	what we want (support compilers who lack them).
	
	* src/insets/Makefile.am, src/mathed/Makefile.am: remove src/support
	from includes. It turns out is was stupid.
 
1999-10-14  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* lib/Makefile.am (install-data-local): forgot a ';'
	(install-data-local): forgot a '\'
	(libinstalldirs): needed after all. reintroduced.

1999-10-13  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): added lyx.spec

	* development/lyx.spec: removed file

	* development/lyx.spec.in: new file

	* po/*.po: merged with lyx.pot becuase of make distcheck
	
	* lib/Makefile.am (dist-hook): added dist-hook so that
	documentation files will be included when doing a make
	dist/distdir/distcheck. Requires cvs export -r HEAD lyxdoc to run.
	(pkgdata_SCRIPTS): added configure.cmd for now, we can use som
	conditional later.
	more: tried to make install do the right thing, exclude CVS dirs
	etc.

	* src/LaTeXLog.C (ShowLatexLog): reordered som statements so that
	Path would fit in more nicely.

	* all files that used to use pathstack: uses now Path instead.
	This change was a lot easier than expected.
	
	* src/support/path.h: new file

	* src/support/Makefile.am (libsupport_a_SOURCES): added path.h

	* src/Makefile.am (lyx_SOURCES): removed pathstack.[Ch]

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (getline): Default arg was given for
	para 3. removed.

	* Configure.cmd: removed file 

1999-10-13  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/DebugStream.[Ch]: remove the explicit std:: before
	streams classes and types, add the proper 'using' statements when
	MODERN_STL is defined.
	
	* src/debug.h: move the << operator definition after the inclusion
	of DebugStream.h

	* src/support/filetools.C: include "LAssert.h", which is needed
	later. 

	* src/insets/Makefile.am, src/mathed/Makefile.am: add src/support
	to includes. 

	* src/lyxfont.h, src/commandtags.h, src/mathed/math_defs.h:
	include "debug.h" to define a proper ostream.

1999-10-12  Asger Alstrup Nielsen  <alstrup@alstrup.galaxy.dk>

	* src/sys*: Cleaned up the Systemcall stuff a bit. Added "kill(int)"
	  method to the SystemCall class which can kill a process, but it's
	  not fully implemented yet.

	* src/*.C: Changed Systemcalls::Startscript() to startscript()

	* src/support/FileInfo.h: Better documentation	

	* src/lyxfunc.C: Added support for buffer-export html
	
	* src/menus.C: Added Export->As HTML...
	
	* lib/bind/*.bind: Added short-cut for buffer-export html

	* src/lyxrc.*: Added support for new \tth_command
	
	* lib/lyxrc.example: Added stuff for new \tth_command

1999-10-12  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* lib/Makefile.am (IMAGES): removed images/README
	(pkgdata_SCRIPTS): use this instead of bin_SCRIPTS to that it
	installes in correct place. Check permisions is installed
	correctly.

	* src/LaTeX.C: some no-op changes moved declaration of some
	variables around.

	* src/LaTeX.h (LATEX_H): changed include guard name

1999-10-12  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/reLyX/Makefile.am: install noweb2lyx.

	* lib/Makefile.am: install configure. 

	* lib/reLyX/configure.in: declare a config aux dir; set package
	name to lyx (not sure what the best solution is); generate noweb2lyx.

	* lib/layouts/egs.layout: fix the bibliography layout.

1999-10-08  Jürgen Vigna <jug@sad.it>

	* src/support/filetools.C (FileOpenSearch): Fixed a bug where
	when in the PATH was something like /usr/bin;;/bin (note: the ;;)
	it returned without continuing to search the path.
	
1999-10-07  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/insets/insetquotes.C (Draw): Simplified a gread deal. This
	also fixes a bug. It is not allowed to do tricks with std::strings
	like: string a("hei"); &a[e]; this will not give what you
	think... Any reason for the complexity in this func?

1999-10-06  Asger Alstrup Nielsen  <alstrup@diku.dk>

	* Updated README and INSTALL a bit, mostly to check that my
	CVS rights are correctly set up.

1999-10-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (helper): removed bogus Assert. strlen
	does not allow '\0' chars but lyxstring and std::string does.

1999-10-05  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* autogen.sh (AUTOCONF): let the autogen script create the
	POTFILES.in file too. POTFILES.in should perhaps now not be
	included in the cvs module.

	* some more files changed to use C++ includes instead of C ones.

	* src/filedlg.C (Reread): fixed a bug wrt Time. It was appended
	not assigned.
	(Reread): added tostr to nlink. buggy output otherwise.
	(Reread): added a string() around szMode when assigning to Buffer,
	without this I got a log of garbled info strings.

	* acconfig.h: commented out the PTR_AS_INT macros. They should not
	be needed.

	* I have added several ostream & operator<<(ostream &, some_type)
	functions. This has been done to avoid casting and warnings when
	outputting enums to lyxerr. This as thus eliminated a lot of
	explicit casts and has made the code clearer. Among the enums
	affected: kb_action, InsetLatexAccent::ACCENT_TYPE, a couple of
	mathed enums, some font enum the Debug::type enum. 

	* src/support/lyxstring.h (clear): missing method. equivalent of
	erase(0, npos).

	* all files that contained "stderr": rewrote constructs that used
	stderr to use lyxerr instead. (except bmtable)

	* src/support/DebugStream.h (level): and the passed t with
	Debug::ANY to avoid spurious bits set.

	* src/debug.h (Debug::type value): made it accept strings of the
	type INFO,INIT,KEY.

	* configure.in (Check for programs): Added a check for kpsewhich,
	the latex generation will use this later to better the dicovery of
	all used files. 

	* src/BufferView.C (create_view): we don't need to cast this to
	(void*) that is done automatically.
	(WorkAreaButtonPress): removed some dead code.

1999-10-05  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/minibuffer.C (Init): make sure that the "Welcome to LyX!"
	is not overwritten when translated (David Sua'rez de Lis).

	* lib/CREDITS: Added David Sua'rez de Lis

	* lib/reLyX/configure.in: setup LYX_DIR correctly in reLyX.

	* src/bufferparams.C (BufferParams): default input encoding is now
	"latin1" 

	* acinclude.m4 (cross_compiling): comment out macro
	LYX_GXX_STRENGTH_REDUCE. 

	* acconfig.h: make sure that const is not defined (to empty) when
	we are compiling C++. Remove commented out code using SIZEOF_xx
	macros.
	
	* configure.in : move the test for const and inline as late as
	possible so that these C tests do not interefere with C++ ones.
	Remove the call to LYX_GXX_STRENGTH_REDUCE, since its usefulness
	has not been proven. 

1999-10-04  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/table.C (getDocBookAlign): remove bad default value for
	isColumn parameter.

	* src/menus.C (ShowFileMenu): add a missing tostr() for lastfiles
	shortcut. 
	(ShowFileMenu2): ditto.

	* lib/reLyX/.cvsignore: add configure and aclocal.m4 to the list
	of files to ignore.

1999-10-04  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* Most files: finished the change from the old error code to use
	DebugStream for all lyxerr debugging. Only minor changes remain
	(e.g. the setting of debug levels using strings instead of number) 

1999-10-02  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/layout.C (Add): Changed to use compare_no_case instead of
	strcasecmp.

	* src/FontInfo.C: changed loop variable type too string::size_type.

1999-10-01  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/Makefile.am: added -I${srcdir}/../ to INCLUDES and
	set ETAGS_ARGS to --c++ 

1999-09-30  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/table.C (DocBookEndOfCell): commented out two unused variables

	* src/paragraph.C: commented out four unused variables. 

	* src/lyx_cb.C (TocUpdateCB): moved variable i and added a new i
	insed a if clause with type string::size_type.

	* src/lyxfr1.C (IsSearchStringInText): changed iSrch from int to
	string::size_type.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): use string::size_type as loop variable.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (ReplaceWord): use string::size_type as loop
	variable, also changed loop to go from 0 to lenght + 1, instead of
	-1 to length. This should be correct.

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanError): use string::size_type as loop variable
	type.

	* src/BufferView.C (WorkAreaButtonPress): moved #if 0 up two lines
	(l.896) since y_tmp and row was not used anyway.

	* src/insets/insetref.C (escape): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.

	* src/insets/insetquotes.C (Width): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.
	(Draw): use string::size_type as loop variable type.

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (checkContents): use
	string::size_type as loop variable type.

	* src/insets/insetlabel.C (escape): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.

	* src/insets/insetinfo.C: added an extern for current_view.

	* src/insets/insetcommand.C (scanCommand): use string::size_type
	as loop variable type.

	* most files: removed the RCS tags. With them we had to recompile
	a lot of files after a simple cvs commit. Also we have never used
	them for anything meaningful. 

	* most files: tags-query-replace NULL 0. As adviced several plases
	we now use "0" instead of "NULL" in our code. 

	* src/support/filetools.C (SpaceLess): use string::size_type as
	loop variable type.

1999-09-29  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/paragraph.C: fixed up some more string stuff.

1999-09-28  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/filetools.h: make modestr a std::string.

	* src/filetools.C (GetEnv): made ch really const.

	* src/lyxlib.h: removed the Maximum and Minimum inline functions,
	made code that used these use max/min from <algorithm> instead.

	* changed several c library include files to their equivalent c++
	library include files. All is not changed yet.

	* created a support subdir in src, put lyxstring and lstrings
	there + the extra files atexit, fileblock, strerror. Created
	Makefile.am. edited configure.in and src/Makefile.am to use this
	new subdir. More files moved to support.

	* imported som of the functions from repository lyx, filetools
	
	* ran tags-query-replace on LString -> string, corrected the bogus
	cases. Tried to make use of lstrings.[hC], debugged a lot. There
	is still some errors in there. This is errors where too much or
	too litle get deleted from strings (string::erase, string::substr,
	string::replace), there can also be some off by one errors, or
	just plain wrong use of functions from lstrings. Viewing of quotes
	is wrong. 

	* LyX is now running fairly well with string, but there are
	certainly some bugs yet (see above) also string is quite different
	from LString among others in that it does not allow null pointers
	passed in and will abort if it gets any.
	
        * Added the revtex4 files I forgot when setting up the repository.

1999-09-27  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* All over: Tried to clean everything up so that only the files
	  that we really need are included in the cvs repository.
	* Switched to use automake.
	* Generaton of reLyX is not perfect, LYX_DIR does not get substituted.
	* Install has not been checked.

1999-09-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* po/pt.po: Three errors:
	       l.533 and l.538 format specification error
	       l. 402 duplicate entry, I just deleted it.
