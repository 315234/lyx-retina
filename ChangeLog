1999-10-25  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/paragraph.C (SimpleTeXBlanks): spaces are automatically made

	(lyx_opt): prereleases compile with same optimization as development 
	(CXXFLAGS): only use pedantic if we are a development version 

	* src/BufferView.C (restorePosition): don't do anything if the
	backstack is empty.

	* src/BackStack.h: added member empty, use this to test if there
	is anything to pop...

	* forms/form_url.fd +
	* src/insets/form_url.[Ch]: added because it's cleaner and easier
	to modify IMO.

	* src/insets/Makefile.am: added files form_url.[Ch]
	
1999-10-25  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* INSTALL: it is now possible to compile LyX with digital C++ 6.1
	(and presumably 6.2).

	* src/{BufferView,LyXView,combox,filedlg,intl,lyxserver,lyxvc,
	menus,minibuffer,toolbar}.{C,h}: added C_xxx wrappers around
	remaining static member callbacks. 

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): Use _() instead of N_() fot minibuffer
	messages. 

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: declare struct Srep as friend of
	lyxstring, since DEC cxx complains otherwise.

1999-10-24  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/spellchecker.C (create_ispell_pipe): removed old #warning,
	the code has shown itself to work
	(create_ispell_pipe): removed another warning, added a comment
	instead. 

	* src/minibuffer.C (ExecutingCB): removed code that has been
	commented out a long time

	* src/lyxfunc.C (processKeyEvent): removed some very old commented
	out code + a warning.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: comment out the three private
	operators, when compiling with string ansi conforming compilers
	they make problems.

	* src/mathed/math_symbols.C (AddBitmap): change 6th arg to be
	unsigned char *.
	(pixmapFromBitmapData): change type of bdata to be unsigned char *

	XReadBitmapFileData.

	* images/arrows.xbm: made the arrays unsigned char *
	* images/varsz.xbm: ditto
	* images/misc.xbm: ditto
	* images/greek.xbm: ditto
	* images/dots.xbm: ditto
	* images/brel.xbm: ditto
	* images/bop.xbm: ditto

	needed. 
	(LYX_CXX_CHEADERS): added <clocale> to the test. 

1999-10-23  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyx_cb.C (addNewlineAndDepth): changed to use string::append.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (append): fixed something that must be a
	bug, rep->assign was used instead of rep->append.

	* src/support/Makefile.am (libsupport_a_SOURCES): added LIstream.h
	and LOstream.h

	* src/lyxfunc.C (processKeyEvent): removed faulty line that made
	lyx insert double chars. Fix spotted by Kayvan.

1999-10-23  Asger Alstrup Nielsen  <alstrup@alstrup.galaxy.dk>

	* Fixed the tth support. I messed up with the Emacs patch apply feature
	and omitted the changes in lyxrc.C.

1999-10-22  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/figinset.C (CallbackFig): Just changed the defines a bit.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuInsertRef) + 
	* src/lyx_gui.C (create_forms): Inserted fl_set_form_minsize so that
	the form cannot be resized under it limits (fixes a segfault)
	
	* src/lyx.C (create_form_form_ref) +
	* forms/lyx.fd: Changed Gravity on name input field so that it is
 	resized correctly.

1999-10-22  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* configure.in: use LYX_CXX_STL_MODERN_STREAMS; check for headers
	<ostream> and <istream>.
	
	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_STL_MODERN_STREAMS): new test. Checks
	whether <fstream> provides the latest standard features, or if we
	have an oldstyle library (like in egcs).
	(LYX_CXX_STL_STRING): fix the test.

	* src/support/DebugStream.{C,h}: use L{I,O}stream.h and condition the
	code on MODERN_STL_STREAM.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: use L{I,O}stream.h.

	* src/support/L{I,O}stream.h: new files, designed to setup
	correctly streams for our use
	  - includes the right header depending on STL capabilities
	  - puts std::ostream and std::endl (for LOStream.h) or
	  std::istream (LIStream.h) in toplevel namespace.

1999-10-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/insets/figinset.C: added ifdef guards around the fl_free
	code that jug commented out. Now it is commented out when
	compiling with XForms == 0.89.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C: moved the definition of lyxstring::Srep
	to lyxstring.C, and only keep a forward declaration in
	lyxstring.h. Simplifies the header file a bit and should help a
	bit on compile time too. Also changes to Srep will not mandate a
	recompile of code just using string.
	(~lyxstring): definition moved here since it uses srep.
	(size): definition moved here since it uses srep.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: removed a couple of "inline" that should
	not be there.

1999-10-21  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/insets/inseturl.C (C_InsetUrl_CloseUrlCB): forgot to pass
	the 'ob' argument.

1999-10-21  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/table.C (SetPWidth): Just a small fix so the alignment is not
	set to left if I just remove the width entry (or it is empty).

	* src/text2.C (SetCursorIntern): Fixed a bug calculating to use wrong
	paragraph when having dummy paragraphs.

1999-10-20  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/figinset.C: just commented some fl_free_form calls
	and added warnings so that this calls should be activated later
	again. This avoids for now a segfault, but we have a memory leak!

	* src/lyxfunc.C (processKeyEvent) (Dispatch): changed
 	'const char * argument' to 'string argument', this should
	fix some Asserts() in lyxstring.C.

	* src/lyxfunc.h: Removed the function argAsString(const char *)
	as it is not used anymore.

1999-10-20  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (helper): changed to use
	sizeof(object->rep->ref).
	(operator>>): changed to use a pointer instead.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: changed const reference & to value_type
	const & lets see if that helps.

1999-10-19  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* Makefile.am (rpmdist): fixed to have non static package and
	verison.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C: removed the compilation guards

	* src/vspace.C (nextToken): use i + 1  instead of ++i. Maks things
	a bit clearer.

	* src/support/Makefile.am (LYXSTRING): bruker USE_LYXSTRING for
	conditional compile of lyxstring.Ch

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_STL_STRING): new and improved, still a
	stupid check, but it is a lot better than the bastring hack. 
	(LYX_CXX_STL_STRING): bruker nå AM_CONDITIONAL(USE_LYXSTRING  

	* several files: changed string::erase into string::clear. Not
	really needed.
	
	* src/chset.C (encodeString): use a char temporary instead

	* src/table.C (TexEndOfCell): added tostr around
	column_of_cell(fcell+i)+1 and around right_column_of_cell(fcell+i)+1
	(TexEndOfCell): ditto
	(TexEndOfCell): ditto
	(TexEndOfCell): ditto
	(DocBookEndOfCell): ditto
	(DocBookEndOfCell): ditto
	(DocBookEndOfCell): ditto
	(DocBookEndOfCell): ditto

	* src/paragraph.C (TeXEnvironment): added tostr around foot_count -1

	* src/lyxfr1.C (SearchReplaceAllCB): added tostr around replace_count

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuRunLaTeX): added tostr around ret
	(MenuBuildProg): added tostr around ret
	(MenuRunChktex): added tostr around ret
	(DocumentApplyCB): added tostr around ret

	* src/chset.C (encodeString): added tostr around t->ic

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): added tostr around secnumdepth
	(makeLaTeXFile): added tostr around tocdepth
	(makeLaTeXFile): added tostr around ftcound - 1

	* src/insets/insetbib.C (setCounter): added tostr around counter.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: added an operator+=(int) to catch more
	mistakes. 

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (lyxstring): We DON'T allow NULL pointers.
	(lyxstring): We DON'T allow NULL pointers.

1999-10-19  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/mathed/math_macro.C (MathMacroArgument::Write,
	MathMacroTemplate::WriteDef): add tostr() around macro arg numbers
	when writing them out.

	* src/LString.C: remove, since it is not used anymore.
	
	* src/support/lyxstring.C: condition the content to
	USE_INCLUDED_STRING macro.

	* src/mathed/math_symbols.C, src/support/lstrings.C,
	src/support/lyxstring.C: add `using' directive to specify what
	we need in <algorithm>. I do not think that we need to
	conditionalize this, but any thought is appreciated.

	* many files: change all callback functions to "C" linkage
	functions to please strict C++ compilers like DEC cxx 6.1 in mode
	strict_ansi. Those who were static are now global. 
  	    The case of callbacks which are static class members is
	trickier, since we have to make C wrappers around them (see
	InsetError, InsetInfo and InsetUrl). The same holds for friends. I
	did not finish this yet, since it defeats the purpose of
	encapsulation, and I am not sure what the best route is.

1999-10-19  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (lyxstring): we permit to have a null
	pointer as assignment value and just don't assign it.

	* src/vspace.C (nextToken): corrected this function substituting
	find_first(_not)_of with find_last_of.

	* src/TableLayout.C (UpdateLayoutTable) (TableOptionsCB)
 		(TableOptCloseCB) (TableSpeCloseCB):
	inserted fl_set_focus call for problem with fl_hide_form() in
 	xforms-0.89.

1999-10-19  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyx_cb.C (LayoutsCB): fix bug where int was added to a
	string. 

1999-10-18  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxrc.C (Read): RC_PRINTEXSTRAOPTIONS now uses
	LyXLex::next() and not eatline() to get its argument.

1999-10-16  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* Makefile.am (rpmdist): added a rpmdist target

	* lib/reLyX/Makefile.am: added RelyxFigure.pm and Verbatim.pm as
	per Kayvan's instructions.

1999-10-15  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/Makefile.am: add a definition for localedir, so that locales
	are found after installation (Kayvan)

1999-10-14  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* development/.cvsignore: new file.

1999-10-14  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_CHEADERS): New macro. Checks whether the
	C++ compiler provides wrappers for C headers and use our alternate
	version otherwise.

	* configure.in: use LYX_CXX_CHEADERS.

	* src/cheader/: new directory, populated with cname headers from
	libstdc++-2.8.1. They are a bit old, but probably good enough for
	what we want (support compilers who lack them).
	
	* src/insets/Makefile.am, src/mathed/Makefile.am: remove src/support
	from includes. It turns out is was stupid.
 
1999-10-14  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* lib/Makefile.am (install-data-local): forgot a ';'
	(install-data-local): forgot a '\'
	(libinstalldirs): needed after all. reintroduced.

1999-10-13  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): added lyx.spec

	* development/lyx.spec: removed file

	* development/lyx.spec.in: new file

	* po/*.po: merged with lyx.pot becuase of make distcheck
	
	* lib/Makefile.am (dist-hook): added dist-hook so that
	documentation files will be included when doing a make
	dist/distdir/distcheck. Requires cvs export -r HEAD lyxdoc to run.
	(pkgdata_SCRIPTS): added configure.cmd for now, we can use som
	conditional later.
	more: tried to make install do the right thing, exclude CVS dirs
	etc.

	* src/LaTeXLog.C (ShowLatexLog): reordered som statements so that
	Path would fit in more nicely.

	* all files that used to use pathstack: uses now Path instead.
	This change was a lot easier than expected.
	
	* src/support/path.h: new file

	* src/support/Makefile.am (libsupport_a_SOURCES): added path.h

	* src/Makefile.am (lyx_SOURCES): removed pathstack.[Ch]

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (getline): Default arg was given for
	para 3. removed.

	* Configure.cmd: removed file 

1999-10-13  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/DebugStream.[Ch]: remove the explicit std:: before
	streams classes and types, add the proper 'using' statements when
	MODERN_STL is defined.
	
	* src/debug.h: move the << operator definition after the inclusion
	of DebugStream.h

	* src/support/filetools.C: include "LAssert.h", which is needed
	later. 

	* src/insets/Makefile.am, src/mathed/Makefile.am: add src/support
	to includes. 

	* src/lyxfont.h, src/commandtags.h, src/mathed/math_defs.h:
	include "debug.h" to define a proper ostream.

1999-10-12  Asger Alstrup Nielsen  <alstrup@alstrup.galaxy.dk>

	* src/sys*: Cleaned up the Systemcall stuff a bit. Added "kill(int)"
	  method to the SystemCall class which can kill a process, but it's
	  not fully implemented yet.

	* src/*.C: Changed Systemcalls::Startscript() to startscript()

	* src/support/FileInfo.h: Better documentation	

	* src/lyxfunc.C: Added support for buffer-export html
	
	* src/menus.C: Added Export->As HTML...
	
	* lib/bind/*.bind: Added short-cut for buffer-export html

	* src/lyxrc.*: Added support for new \tth_command
	
	* lib/lyxrc.example: Added stuff for new \tth_command

1999-10-12  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* lib/Makefile.am (IMAGES): removed images/README
	(pkgdata_SCRIPTS): use this instead of bin_SCRIPTS to that it
	installes in correct place. Check permisions is installed
	correctly.

	* src/LaTeX.C: some no-op changes moved declaration of some
	variables around.

	* src/LaTeX.h (LATEX_H): changed include guard name

1999-10-12  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/reLyX/Makefile.am: install noweb2lyx.

	* lib/Makefile.am: install configure. 

	* lib/reLyX/configure.in: declare a config aux dir; set package
	name to lyx (not sure what the best solution is); generate noweb2lyx.

	* lib/layouts/egs.layout: fix the bibliography layout.

1999-10-08  Jürgen Vigna <jug@sad.it>

	* src/support/filetools.C (FileOpenSearch): Fixed a bug where
	when in the PATH was something like /usr/bin;;/bin (note: the ;;)
	it returned without continuing to search the path.
	
1999-10-07  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/insets/insetquotes.C (Draw): Simplified a gread deal. This
	also fixes a bug. It is not allowed to do tricks with std::strings
	like: string a("hei"); &a[e]; this will not give what you
	think... Any reason for the complexity in this func?

1999-10-06  Asger Alstrup Nielsen  <alstrup@diku.dk>

	* Updated README and INSTALL a bit, mostly to check that my
	CVS rights are correctly set up.

1999-10-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (helper): removed bogus Assert. strlen
	does not allow '\0' chars but lyxstring and std::string does.

1999-10-05  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* autogen.sh (AUTOCONF): let the autogen script create the
	POTFILES.in file too. POTFILES.in should perhaps now not be
	included in the cvs module.

	* some more files changed to use C++ includes instead of C ones.

	* src/filedlg.C (Reread): fixed a bug wrt Time. It was appended
	not assigned.
	(Reread): added tostr to nlink. buggy output otherwise.
	(Reread): added a string() around szMode when assigning to Buffer,
	without this I got a log of garbled info strings.

	* acconfig.h: commented out the PTR_AS_INT macros. They should not
	be needed.

	* I have added several ostream & operator<<(ostream &, some_type)
	functions. This has been done to avoid casting and warnings when
	outputting enums to lyxerr. This as thus eliminated a lot of
	explicit casts and has made the code clearer. Among the enums
	affected: kb_action, InsetLatexAccent::ACCENT_TYPE, a couple of
	mathed enums, some font enum the Debug::type enum. 

	* src/support/lyxstring.h (clear): missing method. equivalent of
	erase(0, npos).

	* all files that contained "stderr": rewrote constructs that used
	stderr to use lyxerr instead. (except bmtable)

	* src/support/DebugStream.h (level): and the passed t with
	Debug::ANY to avoid spurious bits set.

	* src/debug.h (Debug::type value): made it accept strings of the
	type INFO,INIT,KEY.

	* configure.in (Check for programs): Added a check for kpsewhich,
	the latex generation will use this later to better the dicovery of
	all used files. 

	* src/BufferView.C (create_view): we don't need to cast this to
	(void*) that is done automatically.
	(WorkAreaButtonPress): removed some dead code.

1999-10-05  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/minibuffer.C (Init): make sure that the "Welcome to LyX!"
	is not overwritten when translated (David Sua'rez de Lis).

	* lib/CREDITS: Added David Sua'rez de Lis

	* lib/reLyX/configure.in: setup LYX_DIR correctly in reLyX.

	* src/bufferparams.C (BufferParams): default input encoding is now
	"latin1" 

	* acinclude.m4 (cross_compiling): comment out macro
	LYX_GXX_STRENGTH_REDUCE. 

	* acconfig.h: make sure that const is not defined (to empty) when
	we are compiling C++. Remove commented out code using SIZEOF_xx
	macros.
	
	* configure.in : move the test for const and inline as late as
	possible so that these C tests do not interefere with C++ ones.
	Remove the call to LYX_GXX_STRENGTH_REDUCE, since its usefulness
	has not been proven. 

1999-10-04  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/table.C (getDocBookAlign): remove bad default value for
	isColumn parameter.

	* src/menus.C (ShowFileMenu): add a missing tostr() for lastfiles
	shortcut. 
	(ShowFileMenu2): ditto.

	* lib/reLyX/.cvsignore: add configure and aclocal.m4 to the list
	of files to ignore.

1999-10-04  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* Most files: finished the change from the old error code to use
	DebugStream for all lyxerr debugging. Only minor changes remain
	(e.g. the setting of debug levels using strings instead of number) 

1999-10-02  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/layout.C (Add): Changed to use compare_no_case instead of
	strcasecmp.

	* src/FontInfo.C: changed loop variable type too string::size_type.

1999-10-01  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/Makefile.am: added -I${srcdir}/../ to INCLUDES and
	set ETAGS_ARGS to --c++ 

1999-09-30  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/table.C (DocBookEndOfCell): commented out two unused variables

	* src/paragraph.C: commented out four unused variables. 

	* src/lyx_cb.C (TocUpdateCB): moved variable i and added a new i
	insed a if clause with type string::size_type.

	* src/lyxfr1.C (IsSearchStringInText): changed iSrch from int to
	string::size_type.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): use string::size_type as loop variable.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (ReplaceWord): use string::size_type as loop
	variable, also changed loop to go from 0 to lenght + 1, instead of
	-1 to length. This should be correct.

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanError): use string::size_type as loop variable
	type.

	* src/BufferView.C (WorkAreaButtonPress): moved #if 0 up two lines
	(l.896) since y_tmp and row was not used anyway.

	* src/insets/insetref.C (escape): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.

	* src/insets/insetquotes.C (Width): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.
	(Draw): use string::size_type as loop variable type.

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (checkContents): use
	string::size_type as loop variable type.

	* src/insets/insetlabel.C (escape): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.

	* src/insets/insetinfo.C: added an extern for current_view.

	* src/insets/insetcommand.C (scanCommand): use string::size_type
	as loop variable type.

	* most files: removed the RCS tags. With them we had to recompile
	a lot of files after a simple cvs commit. Also we have never used
	them for anything meaningful. 

	* most files: tags-query-replace NULL 0. As adviced several plases
	we now use "0" instead of "NULL" in our code. 

	* src/support/filetools.C (SpaceLess): use string::size_type as
	loop variable type.

	* src/paragraph.C: fixed up some more string stuff.

1999-09-28  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/filetools.h: make modestr a std::string.

	* src/filetools.C (GetEnv): made ch really const.

	* src/lyxlib.h: removed the Maximum and Minimum inline functions,
	made code that used these use max/min from <algorithm> instead.

	* changed several c library include files to their equivalent c++
	library include files. All is not changed yet.

	* created a support subdir in src, put lyxstring and lstrings
	there + the extra files atexit, fileblock, strerror. Created
	Makefile.am. edited configure.in and src/Makefile.am to use this
	new subdir. More files moved to support.

	* imported som of the functions from repository lyx, filetools
	
	* ran tags-query-replace on LString -> string, corrected the bogus
	cases. Tried to make use of lstrings.[hC], debugged a lot. There
	is still some errors in there. This is errors where too much or
	too litle get deleted from strings (string::erase, string::substr,
	string::replace), there can also be some off by one errors, or
	just plain wrong use of functions from lstrings. Viewing of quotes
	is wrong. 

	* LyX is now running fairly well with string, but there are
	certainly some bugs yet (see above) also string is quite different
	from LString among others in that it does not allow null pointers
	passed in and will abort if it gets any.
	
        * Added the revtex4 files I forgot when setting up the repository.

1999-09-27  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* All over: Tried to clean everything up so that only the files
	  that we really need are included in the cvs repository.
	* Switched to use automake.
	* Generaton of reLyX is not perfect, LYX_DIR does not get substituted.
	* Install has not been checked.

1999-09-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* po/pt.po: Three errors:
	       l.533 and l.538 format specification error
	       l. 402 duplicate entry, I just deleted it.
