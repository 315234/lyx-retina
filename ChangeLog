1999-10-04  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/table.C (getDocBookAlign): remove bad default value for
	isColumn parameter.

	* src/menus.C (ShowFileMenu): add a missing tostr() for lastfiles
	shortcut. 
	(ShowFileMenu2): ditto.

	* lib/reLyX/.cvsignore: add configure and aclocal.m4 to the list
	of files to ignore.

1999-10-02  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/layout.C (Add): Changed to use compare_no_case instead of
	strcasecmp.

	* src/FontInfo.C: changed loop variable type too string::size_type.

1999-10-01  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/Makefile.am: added -I${srcdir}/../ to INCLUDES and
	set ETAGS_ARGS to --c++ 

1999-09-30  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/table.C (DocBookEndOfCell): commented out two unused variables

	* src/paragraph.C: commented out four unused variables. 

	* src/lyx_cb.C (TocUpdateCB): moved variable i and added a new i
	insed a if clause with type string::size_type.

	* src/lyxfr1.C (IsSearchStringInText): changed iSrch from int to
	string::size_type.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): use string::size_type as loop variable.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (ReplaceWord): use string::size_type as loop
	variable, also changed loop to go from 0 to lenght + 1, instead of
	-1 to length. This should be correct.

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanError): use string::size_type as loop variable
	type.

	* src/BufferView.C (WorkAreaButtonPress): moved #if 0 up two lines
	(l.896) since y_tmp and row was not used anyway.

	* src/insets/insetref.C (escape): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.

	* src/insets/insetquotes.C (Width): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.
	(Draw): use string::size_type as loop variable type.

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (checkContents): use
	string::size_type as loop variable type.

	* src/insets/insetlabel.C (escape): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.

	* src/insets/insetinfo.C: added an extern for current_view.

	* src/insets/insetcommand.C (scanCommand): use string::size_type
	as loop variable type.

	* most files: removed the RCS tags. With them we had to recompile
	a lot of files after a simple cvs commit. Also we have never used
	them for anything meaningful. 

	* most files: tags-query-replace NULL 0. As adviced several plases
	we now use "0" instead of "NULL" in our code. 

	* src/support/filetools.C (SpaceLess): use string::size_type as
	loop variable type.

1999-09-29  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/paragraph.C: fixed up some more string stuff.

1999-09-28  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/filetools.h: make modestr a std::string.

	* src/filetools.C (GetEnv): made ch really const.

	* src/lyxlib.h: removed the Maximum and Minimum inline functions,
	made code that used these use max/min from <algorithm> instead.

	* changed several c library include files to their equivalent c++
	library include files. All is not changed yet.

	* created a support subdir in src, put lyxstring and lstrings
	there + the extra files atexit, fileblock, strerror. Created
	Makefile.am. edited configure.in and src/Makefile.am to use this
	new subdir. More files moved to support.

	* imported som of the functions from repository lyx, filetools
	
	* ran tags-query-replace on LString -> string, corrected the bogus
	cases. Tried to make use of lstrings.[hC], debugged a lot. There
	is still some errors in there. This is errors where too much or
	too litle get deleted from strings (string::erase, string::substr,
	string::replace), there can also be some off by one errors, or
	just plain wrong use of functions from lstrings. Viewing of quotes
	is wrong. 

	* LyX is now running fairly well with string, but there are
	certainly some bugs yet (see above) also string is quite different
	from LString among others in that it does not allow null pointers
	passed in and will abort if it gets any.
	
        * Added the revtex4 files I forgot when setting up the repository.

1999-09-27  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* All over: Tried to clean everything up so that only the files
	  that we really need are included in the cvs repository.
	* Switched to use automake.
	* Generaton of reLyX is not perfect, LYX_DIR does not get substituted.
	* Install has not been checked.

1999-09-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* po/pt.po: Three errors:
	       l.533 and l.538 format specification error
	       l. 402 duplicate entry, I just deleted it.
