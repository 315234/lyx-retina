Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual covers the customization features present in LyX.
 In it, we discuss issues like keyboard shortcuts, screen previewing options,
 printer options, sending commands to LyX via the LyX Server, internationalizati
on, installing new LaTeX classes and LyX layouts, etc.
 We can't possibly hope to touch on everything you can change---our developers
 add new features faster than we can document them---but we will explain
 the most common customizations and hopefully point you in the right direction
 for some of the more obscure ones.

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
LyXDir
\family default
 and its sub-directories contain a number of files and that can be used
 to customise LyX's behaviour.
 You can change many of these files from within LyX itself through the 
\family sans

 Most customization that you might want to do to LyX is possible through
 this dialog.
 However, many other inner aspects of LyX can be customized by modifying
 the files in

When you reconfigure using

 (see section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand ref

 to have a list of the

 This means that any additional text class file that you might have added

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Running LyX with multiple configurations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The configuration freedom of the local configuration directory may not suffice
 if you want to have more than one configuration at your disposal.
 For example, you may want to be use different key bindings or printer settings
 at different times.
 You can achieve this by having several such directories.
 You then specify which directory to use at run-time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Invoking LyX with the command line switch 
\family typewriter
-userdir
\family default
 
\emph on
<some directory>
\emph default
 instructs the program to read the configuration from that directory, and
 not from the default directory (you can determine the default directory
 by running LyX without this switch as described above).
 If this directory does not exist, LyX offers to create it for you, just
 like it does for the default directory on the first time you run the program.
 You can modify the configuration options in this additional 
\family typewriter
Userdir
\family default
 exactly as you would for the default directory.
 These directories are completely independent (but read on).
 Note that setting the environment variable 
\family typewriter
LYX_USERDIR_15x
\family default
 to some value has exactly the same effect
\family typewriter
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having several configurations also requires more maintenance: if you want
 to add a new layout to 
\family typewriter
Userdir/layouts
\family default
 which you want available from all your configurations, you must add it
 to each directory separately.
 You can avoid this with the following trick: after LyX creates the additional
 directory, most of the subdirectories (see above) are empty.
 If you want the new configuration to mirror an existing one, replace the
 empty subdirectory with a symbolic link to the matching subdirectory in
 the existing configuration.
 Take care with the 
\family typewriter
\series medium
doc/
\family default
\series default
 subirectory, however, since it contains a file written by the configuration
 script (also accessible through 
\family sans
\bar under

ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under

\bar default

\begin_inset LatexCommand ref

\family default
 which is configuration-specific.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
On-screen fonts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The font used to display your documents on the LyX screen is very important,
 since you'll be reading all your documents with this font.
 Therefore it is important that the font is as readable and good-looking
 as possible.
 The LyX team tried to provide the best possible default font for you, but
 since practically all X11 systems are different, it's likely that the default
 fonts will be sub-optimal on your system.
 Fortunately, you can do something about this.
 Before we explain how to do this, you should learn a bit more about fonts
 so that you are better prepared for choosing your fonts, because it is
 a trade-off that is specific to your preferences and the capabilities of
 your system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that this section only deals with the fonts on the 
\emph on
screen
\emph default
 inside the LyX window.
 The fonts that appear on the 
\emph on
paper
\emph default
 
\emph on
output
\emph default
 are independent from these fonts, and are determined by the document class.
 Read the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 to learn how to change the font of the printed version of your document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basically, screen fonts come in two different kinds: scalable outline fonts
 and non-scalable bitmap fonts.
 This distinction seems a bit arbitrary, since non-scalable fonts are actually
 scalable in most modern font renderers.
 The difference lies in the 
\emph on
quality
\emph default
 of the scaling, and the 
\emph on
speed
\emph default
 of display.
 The most important decision is thus whether you should use non-scalable
 bitmap fonts or scalable outline fonts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scalable fonts are built from 
\emph on
outlines
\emph default
 of the single glyphs (i.e.
 characters) in the font.
 This means that each glyph is defined using mathematical curves that are
 well suited for scaling to any requested size.
 This mathematical definition is interpreted by the font renderer and turned
 into a small picture composed of pixels according to which size and glyph,
 the programmer requests.
 This means that scalable fonts will look pretty good in all sizes.
 Well, almost all sizes.
 Since scalable fonts are defined in an abstract way, it can be hard to
 provide a good rendering at small sizes, where each pixel has to be very
 carefully computed to provide a good image.
 Technically it is possible to do this from the mathematical definition,
 but in order to keep the rendering reasonably fast, tradeoffs have to be
 made, and the result is that scalable fonts can be difficult to read at
 small sizes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bitmap fonts on the other hand, are defined by bitmap graphics from the
 start, so they will look good at all the sizes they are meant for.
 However, they don't scale well, because in order to scale a glyph, each
 pixel is enlarged into several pixels.
 It is the same effect that happens if you try to enlarge a picture in 
\family typewriter
xv
\family default
 or any other picture manipulation program.
 In order to relieve this effect, bitmap fonts are typically provided in
 several fixed sizes typically from around 8 pixels high up to 34 pixels
 or so high in steps according to what is believed to be useful.
 The advantage of bitmap fonts is that no complicated computations are necessary
 to display each glyph, so bitmap fonts are thus faster displayed than scalable
 fonts.
 The disadvantage is that sizes that don't exists as fixed versions have
 to be scaled by doubling pixels, and thus look bad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The net result of all this, is that bitmap fonts are generally best for
 the small sizes, where they are available, while scalable fonts are generally
 best for large sizes.
 The logical conclusion would thus be to use bitmap fonts for the small
 sizes, and scalable fonts for the large sizes.
 Unfortunately, this is not a good idea, since bitmap fonts and scalable
 fonts are not designed to be used together, so the overall look of such
 a scheme would be bad.
 The best you can do is thus to try both schemes and decide for yourself
 what suits you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, LyX uses non-scalable bitmap fonts (when using the XForms frontend).
 For serif fonts, 
\emph on
times
\emph default
 is used, for sans serif fonts, 
\emph on
helvetica
\emph default
 is used, while 
\emph on
courier
\emph default
 is used as the monospaced/typewriter font.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following, we will describe what to do if the text does not look
 good in LyX.
 We'll start with the most important parameters: DPI and font zoom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
DPI setting and Font Zoom
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX automatically tries to scale the fonts to look as close as the paper
 output size as possible, except for the so-called font zoom factor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order for this to work on all systems, it relies on the screen DPI (dots
 per inch) setting to be correct.
 The DPI setting for your system is autodetected by LyX using the information
 the X server can provide.
 You can check what LyX autodetects the DPI setting to, by running LyX as
 
\family typewriter
lyx -dbg 2
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On many systems, X is not set up correctly, so you should check that it
 is correct by hand.
 Run 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
xdpyinfo | more
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and write down what the DPI is for the resolution you use (this will be
 close to the value LyX detects).
 It is the number mentioned as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resolution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Also write down the number of pixels you have in the width (the first number
 under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dimensions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then get the good old ruler out of the closet, and measure the width of
 the visible screen-image on your monitor.
 Convert this measurement to inches if you used a centimeter ruler by dividing
 by 2.54.
 Now you can determine the correct DPI setting for your screen by dividing
 the number of pixels in the width by the width of the screen-image on the
 monitor.
 If this number is more than, say, 5 DPI from the detected value, you should
 either fix the X setup, or at least tell LyX that the DPI is different
 than the detected value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you can't fix the X setup (which of course is best since other programs
 than LyX will benefit from this as well), you can tell LyX the correct
 DPI using the 
\family sans
Preferences
\family default
 dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the text is too small or too big for your taste, you should fiddle with
 the font zoom setting.
 This setting is used to scale the point size of the text.
 If your DPI setting is correct, and the font zoom setting is set to 100,
 this means that LyX will try to display the text exactly the same size
 as it will appear on the paper-output.
 If you set the zoom factor to 200, the text will try to be 2 times as big
 as on paper.
 Of course, this will only happen if LyX can find a font that has the appropriat
e size, which you can't count on.
 Since LyX is a WYSIWYM system anyways, this limitation isn't much of an
 issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default font zoom setting is 150, since a monitor is typically wider
 than a piece of paper, but you should try to fiddle with it through the
 
\family sans
Font\InsetSpace ~

\bar under
Z
\bar default
oom
\family default
 setting in the 
\family sans
Preferences
\family default
 dialog to find a size that you like.
 When you've found a setting that seems to work nicely for you (tip: use
 the 
\family sans
\bar under
A
\bar default
pply

 button to keep the dialog open while you experiment), you can make this
 setting the default by using the 
\family sans
\bar under
S
\bar default
ave
\family default
 button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it is often possible to find a suitable size for the text on the screen,
 this doesn't necessarily mean that the fonts are the best ones available
 on your system.
 In order to help you get the most out of your system, you can use the font
 definition commands to fine-tune the look of the text in greater detail
 than merely size.

You can change all of these from within the 
\family sans
Preferences
\family default
 dialog.
 The number of fonts that are available on different systems vary, but the
 program 
\family typewriter
xfontsel
\family default
 should be available everywhere.
 Use that program to find candidate fonts.
 When you've found a font that you like, try to insert the first two elements
 of the name (called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fndry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fmly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in 
\family typewriter
xfontsel
\family default
) in the appropriate field in the 
\family sans
Preferences
\family default
 dialog and press 
\family sans
\bar under
A
\bar default
pply
\family default
.
 LyX will then reformat your document using the new font, and if you like
 the font, you should 
\family sans
\bar under
S
\bar default
ave
\family default
 it.
 One place to start for a new font is to see if the scalable font 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

utopia
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is available.
 Tip: You can see whether a font is a bitmap font or a scalable font by
 checking the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fields in 
\family typewriter
xfontsel
\family default
.
 If the value 0 is available, the font is scalable.
 If the value 0 isn't available, the font is a bitmap font.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you go about scrapping a bitmap font because the larger sizes look
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

blocky
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, you should toggle the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Use scalable fonts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button.
 This is only useful if you use bitmap fonts, because only these don't scale
 well.
 If you define this flag, LyX will only use the fixed font sizes that are
 available, and this guarantees that all bitmap fonts look well.
 (You can see which individual font sizes are available with the 
\family typewriter
xlsfonts
\family default
 command.
 Try 
\family typewriter
man xlsfonts
\family default
.) However, the prize is that the difference between the size of the fonts
 on screen and the size of fonts on paper will be larger because LyX will
 have to be satisfied with the closest available size, and not try to scale
 a size to fit.
 Also, you can risk that some logically different sizes, such as 
\family sans
Large
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Larger
\family default
, will be mapped to the same screen font, making it hard for you to see
 the difference on screen.
 We've decided not to use scalable fonts by default because of these artifacts,
 but since LyX is a WYSIWYM system, many people like to use the flag anyways,
 well-knowing that the font size on the screen can't be trusted.
 But remember that this flag only makes a difference when you use bitmap
 fonts.
 Scalable fonts won't be affected for reasons you should understand by now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One final note regarding this flag: you should know that there is nothing
 wrong with using bitmap and scalable fonts at the same time for different
 purposes.
 For instance, it's common to use the scalable 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Utopia
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the serif text together with a bitmap version of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Helvetica
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And you can safely select the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Use scalable fonts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button without worries: It will only apply to the Helvetica font.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes the artifacts introduced by use of the flag can be relieved by
 using the fine-detail screen font sizes which defines which point sizes
 the different logical font sizes correspond to.
 Run LyX as 
\family typewriter
lyx -dbg 513
\family default
 to see exactly what concrete fonts the logical sizes map to, and try adjusting
 the corresponding entries in the 
\family sans
Preferences
\family default
 dialog until you've managed to hit the nail and get the fonts you want.
 This can be hard to do, because LyX uses the DPI setting and the font zoom
 settings to calculate which exact screen font size to ask the X server
 for, thus obfuscating the mapping.
 If you can't make it by trial-and-error, you can make the process more
 transparent if you set both the DPI setting and font zoom settings to 100---eve
n when this is known to be wrong.
 This will of course make your scalable fonts look weird, so use with care.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Font encoding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, LyX will use fonts meant to write Western European text, including
 all kinds of English.
 This is defined through the so-called 
\emph on
font
\emph default
 
\emph on
encoding
\emph default
.
 If you want to use LyX to write for instance Eastern European text, Cyrillic
 or any other language not covered by the ISO-8859-1 font encoding, you
 can define a different one with the encoding setting.
 This requires you to have special fonts installed.
 You can use 
\family typewriter
xfontsel
\family default
 to see whether this is the case: check the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rgstry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

encdng
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fields for ISO-8859-X values different from ISO-8859-1, and search for
 one that contains the national characters of your language.
 If you find any, enter this encoding in the dialog.
 If not, go searching the Web for appropriate fonts.
 For the Qt frontend, it's recommended you use an iso646 font set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you've set LyX up to use a different font encoding, you should also
 consider changing the font used by dialog windows in LyX.
 For instance, the 
\family sans
Table\InsetSpace ~
of\InsetSpace ~
Contents
\family default
 dialog will not be understandable unless you tell LyX to use a different
 font for this.
 By default the menu font is set to 
\family typewriter
-*-helvetica-medium-r
\family default
, but often Helvetica is not available in the font encoding you need, so
 the dialog allows this to be changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, there are quite a few options that can be used to fine tune
 the look of your fonts.
 This should not scare you from fiddling with the settings, because after
 all, you will hopefully be using LyX for many hours in the future.
 And contrary to real WYSIWYG word processors where you are tied to using
 fonts that have to look good both on paper and on screen, LyX gives you
 the possibility of using fonts that are designed to look good on the screen
 while using a different set of fonts to look good on paper.

Bindings
\begin_inset LatexCommand label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bindings are used to, well, bind a function to a key.
 Several prepackaged binding files are available: a CUA set of bindings
 (familiar as the typical set of PC and CDE set of keyboard shortcuts),
 an Emacs set of bindings, for those of us who follow the One True Way and
 refuse to lower our standards,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Standard
I'm kidding here, of course!
\end_layout

\end_inset

 as well as specialty bindings (broadway and hollywood) and other languages
 (French, German, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If, however, you'd like to customise the keybindings to your own exacting
 tastes, then copy the best-fit file in 
\family typewriter
LyXDir/bind/
\family default
 to your own 
\family typewriter
UserDir/bind/
\family default
 and modify that.
 Don't forget to load this new file into LyX using the 
\family sans
Preferences
\family default
 dialog.
 (For the moment you'll have to restart LyX for these changes to take effect.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX supports internationalization of the user interface (see Chapter\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:i18n"

\end_inset

).
 If your 
\emph on
locale
\emph default
 is set, with the environment variable 
\family typewriter
$LANG
\family default
, LyX will try to use bindfiles by prepending 
\family typewriter
$LANG_
\family default
 to their name.
 For example, you can put a translated copy of some standard bind file in
 your personal 
\family typewriter
bind/
\family default
 directory, and LyX will use it automatically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The syntax of the

Converters, Formats, and Copiers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX has a powerful mechanism to convert to and from any file format using
 external programs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Formats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step is to define your file formats, e.g.
 PDF, if they are not already defined.
 To do so, open the 
\family sans
\bar under
T
\bar default
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
P
\bar default
references:Converters
\family default
 dialog.
 Enter a new format name; a new GUI name (used in, e.g., the View and Export
 menus); and a file extension.
 These are required.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also two flags that can be set using the checkboxes in the dialog.
 The 
\family typewriter
document
\family default
 flag tells LyX that a format is suitable for document export.
 If this flag is set for a format, and if a suitable conversion route exists,
 then the format will appear in the 
\family sans
\bar under
F
\bar default
ile\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
E
\bar default
xport
\family default
 menu.
 The format will also appear in the 
\family sans
\bar under
V
\bar default
iew
\family default
 menu if it has a viewer associated with it.
 (See below.) Pure image formats (e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\family typewriter
png
\family default
) should not have this flag set; formats that can both represent vector
 graphics and documents (e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\family typewriter
pdf
\family default
) should have it set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
vector
\family default
 flag tells LyX whether a format can contain vector graphics.
 This information is used to determine the target format of included graphics
 for 
\family typewriter
pdflatex
\family default
 export.
 Included graphics may need to be converted to either 
\family typewriter
pdf
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
png
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
jpg
\family default
, since 
\family typewriter
pdflatex
\family default
 cannot handle other image formats.
 If an included graphic is not already in 
\family typewriter
pdf
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
png
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
jpg
\family default
 format, it is converted to 
\family typewriter
pdf
\family default
 if the 
\family typewriter
vector
\family default
 flag of the format is set, and otherwise to 
\family typewriter
png
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Format can have a Viewer associated with it.
 For example, you might want to use 
\family typewriter
ghostview
\family default
 to look at PostScript® files, or 
\family typewriter
xdvi
\family default
 to preview the LaTeX output.
 You can enter the program to use as a viewer (and what options to pass
 to it) in the Viewer field.
 You can also modify the viewer associated with a pre-defined format simply
 by changing what you find in this field, clicking the 
\family sans
Modify
\family default
 button, and then (if you're sure you want to do this) clicking the 
\family sans
Apply
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Save
\family default
 button.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
Changes to the formats are kept in the 
\family typewriter
preferences
\family default
 file in you local LyX directory (for example, 
\family typewriter
$HOME/.lyx/
\family default
).
 If you want to restore the defaults, edit this file and delete the lines
 in the Formats and Converters sections.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For example, to change the 
\family typewriter
dvi
\family default
 viewer, select the 
\family typewriter
DVI
\family default
 format in the dialog, change the viewer to be 
\family typewriter
kdvi
\family default
 (or whatever), and hit 
\family sans
\bar under
M
\bar default
odify
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the operating system has a default viewer associated to a format, this
 viewer is used instead of the one defined here in the Windows® and OS X
 versions of LyX.
 (It is planned to implement this feature on other platforms.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Editors are like viewers: Each Format can have an Editor associated to it,
 entered in the Editor field, and the editor associated with a format can
 be altered via the 
\family sans
\bar under
T
\bar default
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
P
\bar default
references:Converters
\family default
 dialog.
 LyX will launch the associated editor whenever an included file
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Standard
This can be an included 
\family typewriter
.tex
\family default
 file, a verbatim included text file, external material or an included graphics
 file.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 needs to be edited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Copiers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each Format can have a Copier associated with it.
 These are defined in the 
\family sans
\bar under
T
\bar default
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
P
\bar default
references:Copiers
\family default
 dialog.
 Since all conversions from one Format to another take place in LyX's temporary
 directory, it is sometimes necessary to modify a file before copying it
 to the temporary directory in order that the conversion may be performed.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the file may refer to other files---images, for example---using
 relative filenames, and these may become invalid when the file is copied
 to the temporary directory.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This is done by the Copier: It copies a file to (or from) the temporary
 directory and may modify it in the process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copiers may also be used for other purposes.
 For example, if appropriate converters are found, LyX will automatically
 install copiers for the html and wordhtml formats.
 When these formats are exported, the copier sees to it that not just the
 main HTML file but various associated files (style files, images, and the
 like) are also copied, and all these files are written to a subdirectory
 of the directory in which the original LyX file was found.
 The copier may of course be customized.
 The optional -e argument takes a comma-separated list of extensions to
 be copied; if it is omitted, all files will be copied.
 The -t argument determines the extension added to the generated directory.
 By default, it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LyXconv
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, so HTML generated from 
\family typewriter
/path/to/filename.lyx
\family default
 will end up in 
\family typewriter
/path/to/filename.html.LyXconv
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definitions of the copiers may use four variables:
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
$$s The LyX system directory (e.g., 
\family typewriter
/usr/share/lyx
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
$$i The input file
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
$$o The output file
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
$$l The `LaTeX name'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The latter is to be given in a form suitable for inclusion in a LaTeX 
\family typewriter

\backslash
include
\family default
 command and is relevant only when exporting files suitable for such inclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Converters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To define a converter from one format to another---e.g., LaTeX to PDF---select
 the Converters panel.
 Choose the `From' and `To' formats, and then enter the program to be used
 in the conversion in the Converter field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You do not have to define converters between all the Formats between which
 you want to convert.
 For example, you will note that there is no `LyX to PostScript®' converter,
 but LyX will export PostScript®.
 It does so by first creating a LaTeX file (no converter needs to be defined
 for this) which it then converts to DVI using the `LaTeX to DVI' converter,
 and then it converts the resulting DVI file to PostScript®.
 LyX finds such `chains' of converters automatically, and it will always
 choose the shortest chain possible.
 You can, though, still define multiple conversion methods between file
 formats.
 For example, the standard LyX configuration provides three ways to convert
 LaTeX to PDF: Directly, using pdflatex; via (DVI and) PostScript®, using
 ps2pdf; or via DVI, using dvipdfm.
 To define such alternate chains, you must define multiple target `file
 formats'.
 In the standard configuration, for example, formats named `pdf', `pdf2',
 and `pdf3' are defined, all of which share the extension `pdf'.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several variables can be used in the definition of converters:
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
$$s The LyX system directory (e.g., 
\family typewriter
/usr/share/lyx
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
$$i The input file
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
$$o The output file
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
$$b The base filename of the input file
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
$$p The path to the input file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the `Extra Flag' field you can enter as many of the following flags as
 you wish, separated by commas:
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
latex This converter runs some form of LaTeX.
 (This will make LyX's LaTeX error logs available.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
needaux Needs the LaTeX .aux file for the conversion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
xml Output is XML.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following three variables are not really flags at all but take an argument
 in the 
\family sans
key\InsetSpace ~
= value
\family default
 format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
parselog If set, the converter's standard error will be redirected to a
 file 
\family typewriter
infile.out
\family default
, and the script given as argument will be run as: 
\family typewriter
script <infile.out >infile.log
\family default
.
 The argument may contain $$s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
resultdir The name of the directory in which the 
\emph on
converter
\emph default
 will dump the generated files.
 LyX will not create this directory, and it does not copy anything into
 it, though it will copy this directory to the destination.
 The argument may contain $$b, which will be replaced by the basename of
 the input and output files, respectively, when the directory is copied.
\newline
Note
 that resultdir and usetempdir make no sense together.
 The latter will be ignored if the former is given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout List
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
resultfile Determines the output filename and may, again, contain $$b.
 Sensible only with resultdir, and optional even then; if not given, it

The rest
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many other configuration options that can be used to customize

 Please ask on the mailing lists if you need some more information; it may
 even prompt us to expand this section.

Internationalizing LyX
\begin_inset LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX supports using a translated interface.
 Last time we checked, LyX provided text in 14 languages together with the
 default English text.
 The language of choice is called your 
\emph on
locale
\emph default
.
 (For further reading on locale settings, see also the documentation for
 locale that comes with your operating system.
 For Linux, the manual page for locale(5) could be a good place to start).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that these translations will work, but do contain a few flaws.
 In particular, all dialogs have been designed with the English text in
 mind, which means that some of the translated text will be too large to
 fit within the space allocated.
 This is only a display problem and will not cause any harm.
 Also, you will find that some of the translations do not define short-cut
 keys for everything.
 Sometimes, there are simply not enough free letters to do it.
 Other times, the translator just hasn't got around to doing it yet.
 Our localization team -- which you may wish to join -- will try to fix
 these shortcomings in future versions of LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Selecting an alternative language for the user interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This feature is disabled by default, meaning that system default language
 will be used.
 To enable an alternative language, you have to set an appropriate environment
 variable.
 Use 
\family typewriter
"setenv LANG xx"
\family default
 
\family roman
for csh class shells
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
"export LANG=xx"
\family default
 
\family roman
for sh class shells
\family default
.
 Substitute the 
\family typewriter
xx
\family default
 with the two letter code (or four letter code, like 
\family typewriter
en_GB
\family default
 for British English) for the language you want.
 For instance, 
\family typewriter
no
\family default
 is Norwegian.
 Besides the user interface texts being translated, also the appropriate
 manuals will be presented under the Help menu -- if available.

, to override the system settings; their preference is in this order

, which corresponds to the way GNU 
\family typewriter

 Consult your system documentation.
 Normally, you'll want to put the appropriate line in a shell script run
 on start-up, so that the translation is on by default.
 Remember that this affects

Translating LyX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Translating the graphical user interface (text messages).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX uses the GNU 
\family typewriter
gettext
\family default
 library to handle the internationalization of the interface.
 To have LyX speak your favorite language in all menus and dialogs, you
 need a 
\family typewriter
po
\family default
-file for that language.
 When this is available, you'll have to generate a mo-file from it and install
 the 
\family typewriter
mo
\family default
-file.
 The process of doing all of this is explained in the documentation for
 GNU 
\family typewriter
gettext
\family default
, but in short, this is what you do (

We recommend that you use Emacs to do this, since the

\end_layout

\end_inset


\family default
.
 For some menu- and widget-labels, there are also shortcut keys that should
 be translated.
 Those keys are marked after a `|', and should be translated according to
 the words and phrases of the 
\series bold
xx
\series default
-language.
 There is a tool named 
\family typewriter
scgen.pl
\family default
 written in Prolog in 
\family typewriter
LYX-SOURCE-DIR/development/tools/
\family default
 that may be useful to help determine short-cut keys.
 Note that XForms (version 0.86 at least) can't handle anything but 7-bit
 characters as shortcut keys.
 You should also fill also out the information at the beginning of the new
 
\family typewriter

\family default

 suggestions and entertaining flames.

Adding a new po-file to the 
\emph on
distribution
\emph default
 of LyX involves altering the configure scripts and more, but the way 
\family typewriter
gettext
\family default
 works, you don't actually need the source-code of LyX to translate it---having
 
\family typewriter
lyx.pot
\family default
 (or an existing 
\family typewriter
po
\family default
-file) and the 
\family typewriter
gettext
\family default
 tools suffices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you've written a translation file for a language that LyX does not currently
 support, feel free to submit it for inclusion by sending a patch.
 In this case, we recommend that you read the 
\family typewriter
README
\family default
 provided in the 
\family typewriter
LYX-SOURCE-DIR/po/
\family default
 directory for more instructions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Ambigous messages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes it turns out that one english message needs to be translated into
 different messages in the target language.
 One example is the message 
\family typewriter
To
\family default
 which has the german translation 
\family typewriter
\lang german
Nach
\family default
\lang english
 or 
\family typewriter
\lang german
Bis
\family default
\lang english
.
 
\family typewriter
gettext
\family default
 does not handle such ambigous translations.
 Therefore you have to add some context information to the message: Instead
 of 
\family typewriter
To
\family default
 it becomes 
\family typewriter
To[[as in 'From format x to format y']]
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
To[[as in 'From page x to page y']].

\family default
 Now the two occurences of 
\family typewriter
To
\family default
 are different for 
\family typewriter
gettext
\family default
 and can be translated correctly to 
\family typewriter
\lang german
Nach
\family default
\lang english
 and 
\family typewriter
\lang german
Bis
\family default
\lang english
, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course the context information needs to be stripped off the original
 message when no translation is used.
 Therefore you have to put it in double square brackets at the end of the
 message (see the example above).
 The translation mechanism of LyX ensures that everything in double square
 brackets at the end of messages is removed before displaying the message.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Translating the documentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The online documentation (in the

\begin_inset Foot

As of February 2003, almost all of the docs have been translated into German

 The 
\emph on

\emph default
 has been translated into at least 12 other languages, with other translations
 in progress.
 The library of translated documents is growing rapidly.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, and the locale is set accordingly, these will be used automagically by
 LyX.
 LyX looks for translated versions as 
\family typewriter
LyXDir/doc/
\series bold
xx
\series default
_DocName.lyx
\family default
, where 
\family typewriter
\series bold
xx
\family default
\series default
 denotes the language as set by the environmental variable 
\family typewriter
$LANG
\family default
.
 If there are none, the default English versions will be displayed.
 Note that the translated versions must have the same filenames (
\family typewriter
DocName
\family default
 above) as the original.
 If you feel up to translating the documentation (an excellent way to proof-read
 the original documentation BTW!), there are a few things you should do
 right away:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Read 
\family typewriter
DocStyle.lyx
\family default
, the guide to writing LyX documentation.
 Pay special attention to the translator's section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Check out the documentation translation web page at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand url

.
 That way, you can find out which (if any) documents have already been translate
d into your language.
 You can also find out who (if anyone) is organizing the effort to translate
 the documentation into your language.
 If no one is organizing the effort, please let us know that you're interested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you get to actually translating, here's a few hints for you that may
 save you trouble:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Learn the typographic conventions for the language you are translating to.
 Typography is an ancient art and over the centuries, a great variety of
 conventions have developed throughout different parts of the world.
 Also study the professional terminology amongst typographers in your country.
 Inventing your own terminology will only confuse the users.

Sometimes the original document (from the LyX-team) will be updated.

 That way you can easily see which parts of the translated document need
 to be updated.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dead Keys
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a second way to add support for international characters through
 so-called dead-keys.
 A dead-key works in combination with a letter to produce an accented character.
 Here, we'll explain how to create a really simple dead-key to illustrate
 how they work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose you happen to need the circumflex character, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 ̂
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 You could bind the 
\family sans
^
\family default
-key [a.k.a.\InsetSpace ~

\family sans
Shift-6
\family default
] to the LyX command 
\family typewriter
accent-circumflex
\family default
 in your 
\family typewriter
lyxrc
\family default
 file.
 Now, whenever you type the 
\family sans
^
\family default
-key followed by a letter, that letter will have a circumflex accent on
 it.
 For example, the sequence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
^e
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 produces the letter: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ê
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If you tried to type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
^t
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, however, LyX will complain with a beep, since a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
t
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 never takes a circumflex accent.
 Hitting 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 after a dead-key produces the bare-accent.
 Please note this last point! If you bind a key to a dead-key, you'll need
 to rebind the character on that key to yet another key.
 Binding the 
\family sans
,-key
\family default
 to a cedilla is a bad idea, since you'll only get cedillas instead of commas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One common way to bind dead-keys is to use 
\family sans
Meta-
\family default
, 
\family sans
Ctrl-
\family default
, and 
\family sans
Shift-
\family default
 in combination with an accent, like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
~
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
,
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
^
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Another way involves using 
\family typewriter
xmodmap
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
xkeycaps
\family default
 [remember them from section?] to set up the special 
\family typewriter
Mode_Switch
\family default
 key.
 The 
\family typewriter
Mode_Switch
\family default
 acts in some ways just like 
\family sans
Shift
\family default
 and permits you to bind keys to accented characters.
 You can also turn keys into dead-keys by binding them to something like
 
\family typewriter
usldead_cedilla
\family default
 and then binding this symbolic key to the corresponding LyX command.

Installing New Document Classes
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, we describe the procedures for creating and installing
 new LyX layout and template files, as well as offer a refresher on correctly
 installing new LaTeX document classes.
 Some definitions: a document class is a LaTeX file (usually ending in 
\family typewriter
.cls
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
.sty
\family default
) which describes the format of a document such as an article, report, journal
 preprint, etc.
 and all the commands needed to realize that format.
 A layout file is a LyX file which corresponds to a LaTeX document class
 and which tells LyX how to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

draw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 things on the screen to make the display look something like the final
 printed page.
 More precisely, a layout file describes a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

text class
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is the internal construct LyX uses to render the screen display.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Layout
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

text class
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be used somewhat interchangeably, but it is better to refer to the
 file as the layout, and the thing living in LyX's memory as the text class.
 A template file is simply a LyX document which contains a set of predefined
 entries for a given document class which are generally required for that
 class.
 Templates are especially useful for things like journal manuscripts which
 are to be submitted electronically.

Installing a new LaTeX package

Some installations may not include a LaTeX package that you would like to
 use within LyX.
 For example, you might need FoilTeX, a common (and very powerful) package
 for preparing slides or viewgraphs for overhead projectors.
 Here are the formal steps involved in getting the package up and running
 if you are using teTeX or some other web2c based distribution.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Read the file 
\family typewriter
texmf.cnf
\family default
 (this usually lives in the directory 
\family typewriter
$TEXMF/web2c
\family default
, though you can run 
\family typewriter
kpsewhich texmf.cnf
\family default
 to locate it).
 It describes how to add a local 
\family typewriter
texmf
\family default
 directory; follow the instructions.
 You need to insert the name of your local 
\family typewriter
texmf
\family default
 directory in 
\family typewriter
texmf.cnf
\family default
.
 Under Linux, 
\family typewriter
/usr/local
\family default
 is a logical place to install software that did not come with your distribution
, so you might use 
\family typewriter
/usr/local/texmf
\family default
.
 Usually, you will have to modify only two things:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Set 
\family typewriter
TEXMFLOCAL
\family default
 to the directory you chose; e.g.
 
\newline

\family typewriter
TEXMFLOCAL = /usr/local/texmf
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Make sure 
\family typewriter
TEXMF
\family default
 includes the 
\family typewriter
TEXMFLOCAL
\family default
 variable; e.g.
 
\newline

\family typewriter
TEXMF = {$HOMETEXMF,!!$TEXMFLOCAL,!!$TEXMFMAIN}
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Create your local 
\family typewriter
texmf
\family default
 directory (e.g.
 
\family typewriter
/usr/local/texmf
\family default
).
 You must follow the directory structure of your existing 
\family typewriter
texmf
\family default
 directory (for example, latex packages should go under 
\family typewriter
/usr/local/texmf/tex/latex/
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Install the package.
 For example, you would unpack the FoilTeX tarball and create 
\family typewriter
/usr/local/texmf/tex/latex/foiltex
\family default
.
 The 
\family typewriter
foiltex
\family default
 directory contains various files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Run: 
\family typewriter
texhash
\family default
.
 This should create 
\family typewriter
/usr/local/texmf/ls-R
\family default
 amongst others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
From within LyX, do: 
\family sans
\bar under
T
\bar default
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
R
\bar default
econfigure
\family default
.
 Restart LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you should see your new package---for example 
\family sans
slides (FoilTeX)
\family default
---under 
\family sans
\bar under
L
\bar default
ayout\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
D
\bar default
ocument
\family default
, field 
\family sans
\bar under
C
\bar default
lass
\family default
.
 Note that there are simpler ways of installing packages: you can add a
 link to the new package directory in the system LaTeX directory (
\family typewriter
$TEXMF/tex/latex
\family default
, don't forget to then run 
\family typewriter
texconfig
\family default
), or sometimes simply set the 
\family typewriter
$TEXINPUTS
\family default
 environment variable to include the new package.
 However, the formal procedure described in 
\family typewriter
texmf.cnf
\family default
 is guaranteed to work, so you should follow it unless circumstances absolutely
 prevent it: such as, when you don't have superuser access.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Layouts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes how to write and install your own LyX layout files
 (also known as text classes) and walks through the 
\family typewriter
article
\family default
 text class format as an example.
 The 
\family typewriter
.layout
\family default
 files describe what paragraph styles are available for a given document
 class and how LyX should display them.
 We try to provide a thorough description of the process here; however,
 there are so many different types of documents supported by LaTeX classes
 we can't hope to cover every different possibility or problem you might
 encounter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you plan to write a new layout, it is extremely helpful to look at
 the example layouts distributed with LyX.
 If you use a nice LaTeX document class that might be of interest for others,
 too, and have a nice corresponding LyX layout, feel free to contribute
 the stuff to us, so we may put it into the distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the tags described in this chapter are case-insensitive; this means
 that 
\family typewriter
Style
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
style
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
StYlE
\family default
 are really the same command.
 The possible values are printed in brackets after the feature's name.
 The default value if a feature isn't specified inside a text class-description
 is typeset 
\family typewriter
\emph on
emphasized
\family default
\emph default
.
 If the argument has a datatype like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

string
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

float
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the default is shown like this: 
\family typewriter
float=
\emph on
default
\family default
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Supporting new document classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two situations you are likely to encounter when wanting to support
 a new LaTeX document class, involving LaTeX2e class (
\family typewriter
.cls
\family default
) and style (
\family typewriter
.sty
\family default
) files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
A layout for a 
\family sans
sty
\family default
 file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your new document class is provided as a style file that is used in conjuncti
on with an existing, supported document class, start by copying the existing
 class's layout file into your local directory.
 For the sake of example we'll assume that the style file is called 
\family sans
myclass.sty
\family default
 and it is meant to be used with 
\family sans
report.cls
\family default
 which is a standard class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cp report.layout ~/.lyx/layouts/myclass.layout
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then edit 
\family typewriter
myclass.layout
\family default
 and change the line: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
DeclareLaTeXClass{report}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
to read
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
DeclareLaTeXClass[report, myclass.sty]{report (myclass)}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then add:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Preamble 
\newline
    
\backslash
usepackage{myclass}
\newline
EndPreamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
near the top of the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Start LyX and select 
\family sans
\bar under
T
\bar default
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
R
\bar default
econfigure
\family default
.
 Restart LyX and try creating a new document.
 You should see "
\family sans
report (myclass)
\family default
" as a document class option in the 
\family sans
\bar under
D
\bar default
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
S
\bar default
ettings
\family default
 dialog.
 It is likely that some of the sectioning commands and such will differ
 from how the base class
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
report
\family default
 in this example
\end_layout

\end_inset

 works, so you can fiddle around with the settings for the different sections
 if you wish.
 See below for more discussion on this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Layout for a 
\family sans
cls
\family default
 file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, you will probably have to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

roll your own
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 layout.
 We strongly suggest copying an existing layout file which uses a similar
 LaTeX class and modifying it if at all possible.
 At least use an existing file as a starting point so you can find out what
 items you need to worry about.
 Again, the specifics are covered below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Declaring a new text class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When it's finally time to get your hands dirty and create or edit your own
 layout file, the following sections describe what you're up against.
 Our advice is to go slowly, save and test often, listen to soothing music,
 and enjoy one or two of your favorite adult beverages; more if you are
 getting particularly stuck.
 It's really not that hard, except that the multitude of options can become
 overwhelming if you try to do to much in one sitting.
 Go have another adult beverage, just for good measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we go!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lines in a layout file which begin with a 
\family typewriter
#
\family default
 are comments.
 There is one exception to this rule: all layouts should begin with lines
 like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\size small
#% Do not delete the line below; configure depends on this 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\size small
#  
\backslash
DeclareLaTeXClass{article}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second line is used when you configure LyX.
 The layout file is read by the LaTeX script 
\family typewriter
chkconfig.ltx
\family default
, in a special mode where 
\family typewriter
#
\family default
 is ignored.
 The first line is just a LaTeX comment, and the second one contains the
 declaration of the text class.
 If these lines appear in a file named 
\family typewriter
article.layout
\family default
, then they define a text class of name 
\family typewriter
article
\family default
 (the name of the layout file) which uses the LaTeX document class 
\family typewriter
article.cls
\family default
 (the default is to use the same name as the layout).
 The string 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

article
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that appears above is used as a description of the text class in the 
\family sans
\bar under
D
\bar default
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
S
\bar default
ettings
\family default
 dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's assume that you wrote your own text class that uses the 
\family typewriter
article.cls
\family default
 documentclass, but where you changed the appearance of the section headings.
 If you put it in a file 
\family typewriter
myarticle.layout
\family default
, the header of this file should be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\size small
#% Do not delete the line below; configure depends on this 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\size small
#  
\backslash
DeclareLaTeXClass[article]{article (with my own headings)}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This declares a text class 
\family typewriter
myarticle
\family default
, associated with the LaTeX document class 
\family typewriter
article.cls
\family default
 and described as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

article (with my own headings)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If your text class depends on several packages, you can declare it as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\size small
#% Do not delete the line below; configure depends on this 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\size small
#  
\backslash
DeclareLaTeXClass[article,foo.sty]{article (with my own headings)}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This indicates that your text class uses the foo.sty package.
 Finally, it is also possible to declare classes for SGML and DocBook code.
 Typical declarations will look like
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\size small
#% Do not delete the line below; configure depends on this 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\size small
# 
\backslash
DeclareSGMLClass{SGML (LinuxDoc)}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
#% Do not delete the line below; configure depends on this 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
# 
\backslash
DeclareDocBookClass[article]{SGML (DocBook article)}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that these declarations can also be given an optional parameter declaring
 the name of the document class (but not a list).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the text class has been modified to your taste, all you have to do
 is to copy it either in 
\family typewriter
$LyXDir/layouts/
\family default
 or in 
\family typewriter
$UserDir/layouts
\family default
 and run 
\family sans
\bar under
T
\bar default
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
R
\bar default
econfigure
\family default
.
 Exit LyX and restart it; then your new text class should be available along
 with the others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
File format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first non-comment line must contain the file format number:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter

\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

 This is used to typeset nice lists without tabulators.
 
\family typewriter
Dynamic
\family default
 means that the margin depends on the size of the label.
 This is used for automatic enumerated headlines.
 It is obvious that the headline 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

5.4.3.2.1 Very long headline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must have a wider left margin (as wide as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 plus the space) than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

3.2 Very long headline
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, even if other word processors are not able to do this.
 
\family typewriter
First_Dynamic
\family default
 is similar, but only the very first row of the paragraph is dynamic, while
 the others are static; this is used, for example, for descriptions.
 
\family typewriter
Right_Address_Box
\family default
 means the margin is chosen in a way that the longest row of this paragraph
 fits to the right margin.
 This is used to typeset an address on the right edge of the page.

ParIndent
\family default
\series default
 [
\family typewriter
string=""
\family default
] The indent of the very first line of a paragraph.
 The argument is passed as a string.
 For example 
\family typewriter
"MM"
\family default
 means that the paragraph is indented with the width of 
\family typewriter
"MM"
\family default
 in 
\family typewriter
the
\family default
 normal font.
 You can get a negative width by prefixing the string with 
\family typewriter
"-"
\family default
.
 This way was chosen so that the look is the same with each used screen
 font.
 The 
\family typewriter
Parindent
\family default
 will be fixed for a certain layout.
 The exception is Standard layout, since the indentation of a Standard layout
 paragraph can be prohibited with 
\family typewriter
NextNoIndent
\family default
.
 Also, Standard layout paragraphs inside environments use the 
\family typewriter
Parindent
\family default
 of the environment, not their native one.
 For example, Standard paragraphs inside an enumeration are not indented.

 When

 parskip argument.
 The vertical space is calculated with 
\family typewriter

 is the height of a row with the normal font.
 This way, the look stays the same with different screen fonts.

 since a space is considered as the separation between two words, not a
 character or symbol of its own.
 This is a very fine thing but sometimes annoying, for example when typing
 program code or plain LaTeX code.

 lead to empty LaTeX output.
 There are some cases where this could be desirable however: in a letter

 people do not forget them; in some special classes, a layout can be used
 as some kind of break, which does not contain actual text.

Since version 1.3.0 of LyX, it is necessary to define the counters (
\family sans
chapter
\family default
, 
\family sans
figure
\family default
, \SpecialChar \ldots{}
) in the text class itself.
 If you are looking here to learn how to upgrade an existing text class,
 it will probably turn out that all you have to do is to add
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Input stdcounters.inc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definition of counters is presently a bit primitive in LyX, since many
 things are still hardcoded.
 The following two parameters can be used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
\series medium
Name
\family default
\series default
 [
\family typewriter
string
\family default

\family default
\series default
 [
\family typewriter
string

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

] If this is set to the name of another counter, the present counter will
 be reset everytime the other one is increased (is that unclear enough?).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a counter has been associated to a style, it is possible to use some
 special constructs in

\begin_layout Subsection
Upgrading old layout files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file format of layout files changes from time to time, so old layout
 files need to be converted.
 This process has been automated in LyX 1.4.0: If LyX reads an old format
 layout file it will call the conversion tool 
\family typewriter
$LyXDir/scripts/layout2layout.py
\family default
 and convert it to a temporary file in current format.
 The original file is left untouched, so that you can still use it with
 LyX 1.3.x.
 If you want to convert the layout file permanently, just call the converter
 by hand:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
python $LyXDir/scripts/layout2layout.py myclass.layout myclassnew.layout
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then copy 
\family typewriter
myclassnew.layout
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
$UserDir/layouts/
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The automatic conversion does only handle syntax changes.
 It cannot handle the case where the contents of included files was changed.
 For example, layout files based on 
\family typewriter
book.layout
\family default
 need to include 
\family typewriter
numreport.inc
\family default
 in addition to 
\family typewriter
stdclass.inc
\family default
.
 If you get error messages about undefined counters, try to convert your
 file with 
\family typewriter
layout2layout.py
\family default
 and then add one of 
\family typewriter
numarticle.inc
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
numreport.inc
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
numrevtex.inc
\family default
.

Creating Templates

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Templates are created just like usual documents.
 The only difference is that usual documents contain all possible settings,
 including the fontscheme and the papersize.
 Usually a user doesn't want a template to overwrite his defaults in these
 cases.
 For that reason, the designer of a template should remove the corresponding
 commands like 
\family typewriter

\backslash
fontscheme
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter

\backslash
papersize
\family default
 from the template LyX file.
 This can be done with any simple text-editor, for example 
\family typewriter
vi
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
xedit
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Put the edited template files you create in 
\family typewriter
$UserDir/templates/
\family default
, copy the ones you use from the global template directory in 
\family typewriter
$LyXDir/templates/
\family default
 to the same place, and redefine the template path in the 
\family sans

P
\bar default
references
\family default
 dialog (tabs 
\family sans

\family sans

\family default
).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that there is a template which has a particular meaning: 
\family typewriter
defaults.lyx
\family default
.
 This template is loaded everytime you create a new document with 
\family sans
\bar under
F
\bar default
ile
\family default
\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\family sans
\bar under
N
\bar default
ew
\family default
 in order to provide useful defaults.
 To create this template from inside LyX, all you have to do is to open
 a document with the correct settings, and use the 
\family sans
Sa
\bar under
v
\bar default
e as Document Defaults
\family default
 button.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\end_inset

One often requested feature from LyX users is to be able to interface LyX
 with Xfig, Dia, or other similar applications that specialize in producing
 a certain kind of diagram, figure, schematic or whatever material might
 be relevant to include in your document.
 Previously, it was only possible to include boring, static, fixed images
 in LyX documents with the graphics feature, but there are several limitations
 attached to this approach:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you want to change the figure, you have to invoke an external program
 by hand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX does not notice that the referenced files change, so the on-screen display
 can fast become obsolete, and this is aggravated by the lack of a means
 of updating the display
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The graphics stuff does not provide any mechanisms for coping with different
 exported formats such as DocBook, HTML or plain text
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The external material facility attempts to solve all of these problems
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
Even if the graphics facility can't solve all problems, it is still valuable
 because it does provide in-line preview of the graphics, and supports advanced
 geometric transformations with a comfortable user interface.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It does this by offering a general method to interface LyX to external
 applications.
 Instead of introducing a long list of different constructs tailored for
 each specific application, we chose to sacrifice the in-line displaying
 of the included material in order to provide a general construct to cover
 a wide range of applications.
 The result is the external material construct.
 External material presents itself in the document simply as a button, but
 don't let this fool you.
 When you click on it, a dialog will appear that allows you to chose exactly
 what material to include, and in the following sections you will learn
 that this is indeed a powerful mechanism that can solve all of the above
 problems, and more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How does it work?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The external material feature is based on the concept of a 
\emph on
template
\emph default
.
 A template is a specification of how LyX should interface with a certain
 kind of material.
 As bundled, LyX comes with predefined templates for Xfig figures, Dia diagrams,
 various raster format images, gnuplot, and more.
 You can check the actual list by using the menu 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
File\SpecialChar \menuseparator
External
\family default
\InsetSpace ~

\family sans
Material
\family default
.
 Furthermore, it is possible to roll your own template to support a specific
 kind of material.
 Later we'll describe in more detail what is involved, and hopefully you
 will submit all the templates you create so we can include them in a later
 LyX version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another basic idea of the external material feature is to distinguish between
 the original file that serves as a base for final material and the produced
 file that is included in your exported or printed document.
 For example, consider the case of a figure produced with 
\family typewriter
Xfig
\family default
.
 The Xfig application itself works on an original file with the 
\family typewriter
.fig
\family default
 extension.
 Within XFig, you create and change your figure, and when you are done,
 you save the 
\family typewriter
fig
\family default
-file.
 When you want to include the figure in your document, you invoke 
\family typewriter
transfig
\family default
 in order to create a PostScript file that can readily be included in your
 LaTeX file.
 In this case, the 
\family typewriter
.fig
\family default
 file is the original file, and the PostScript file is the produced file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This distinction is important in order to allow updating of the material
 while you are in the process of writing the document.
 Furthermore, it provides us with the flexibility that is needed to support
 multiple export formats.
 For instance, in the case of a plain text file, it is not exactly an award-winn
ing idea to include the figure as raw PostScript.
 Instead, you'd either prefer to just include a reference to the figure,
 or try to invoke some graphics to Ascii converter to make the final result
 look similar to the real graphics.
 The external material management allows you to do this, because it is parameter
ized on the different export formats that LyX supports.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides supporting the production of different products according to the
 exported format, it supports tight integration with editing and viewing
 applications.
 In the case of an XFig figure, you are able to invoke 
\family typewriter
Xfig
\family default
 on the original file with a single click from within the external material
 dialog in LyX, and also preview the produced PostScript file with 
\family typewriter
ghostview
\family default
 with another click.
 No more fiddling around with the command line and/or file browsers to locate
 and manipulate the original or produced files.
 In this way, you are finally able to take full advantage of the many different
 applications that are relevant to use when you write your documents, and
 ultimately be more productive.

\family default
 \SpecialChar \ldots{}

\family default
.
 They can be used by the templates in the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The substitution mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the external material facility invokes an external program, it is done
 on the basis of a command defined in the template configuration file.
 These commands can contain various macros that are expanded before execution.
 Execution always take place in the directory of the containing document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, whenever external material is to be displayed, the name will be produced
 by the substitution mechanism, and most other commands in the template
 definition support substitution as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The available macros are the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$FName The filename of the file specified in the external material dialog.
 This is either an absolute name, or it is relative to the LyX document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$Basename The filename without path and without the extension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$Extension The file extension (including the dot).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$FPath The path part of 
\family typewriter
$$FName
\family default
 (absolute name or relative to the LyX document).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$AbsPath The absolute file path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$RelPathMaster The file path, relative to the master LyX document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$RelPathParent The file path, relative to the LyX document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$AbsOrRelPathMaster The file path, absolute or relative to the master LyX
 document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$AbsOrRelPathParent The file path, absolute or relative to the LyX document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$Tempname A name and full path to a temporary file which will be automatically
 deleted whenever the containing document is closed, or the external material
 insertion deleted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$Contents(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

filename.ext
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) This macro will expand to the contents of the file with the name 
\family typewriter
filename.ext
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$Sysdir This macro will expand to the absolute path of the system directory.
 This is typically used to point to the various helper scripts that are
 bundled with LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All path macros contain a trailing directory separator, so you can construct
 e.g.
 the absolute filename with 
\family typewriter
$$AbsPath$$Basename$$Extension
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The macros above are substituted in all commands unless otherwise noted.
 The command 
\family typewriter
Product
\family default
 supports additionally the following substitutions if they are enabled by
 the 
\family typewriter
Transform
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
TransformCommand
\family default
 commands:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$ResizeFront The front part of the resize command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$ResizeBack The back part of the resize command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$RotateFront The front part of the rotation command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$RotateBack The back part of the rotation command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value string of the 
\family typewriter
Option
\family default
 command supports additionally the following substitutions if they are enabled
 by the 
\family typewriter
Transform
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
TransformOption
\family default
 commands:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$Clip The clip option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$Extra The extra option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$Resize The resize option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
$$Rotate The rotation option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may ask why there are so many path macros.
 There are mainly two reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, relative and absolute file names should remain relative or absolute,
 respectively.
 Users may have reasons to prefer either form.
 Relative names are useful for portable documents that should work on different
 machines, for example.
 Absolute names may be required by some programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, LaTeX treats relative file names differently than LyX and other
 programs in nested included files.
 For LyX, a relative file name is always relative to the document that contains
 the file name.
 For LaTeX, it is always relative to the master document.
 These two definitions are identical if you have only one document, but
 differ if you have a master document that includes part documents.
 That means that relative filenames must be transformed when presented to
 LaTeX.
 Fortunately LyX does this automatically for you if you choose the right
 macros.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So which path macro should be used in new template definitions? The rule
 is not difficult:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use 
\family typewriter
$$AbsPath
\family default
 if an absolute path is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use 
\family typewriter
$$AbsOrRelPathMaster
\family default
 if the substituted string is some kind of LaTeX input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Else use 
\family typewriter
$$AbsOrRelPathParent
\family default
 in order to preserve the user's choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are special cases where this rule does not work and e.g.\InsetSpace ~
relative names
 are needed, but normally it will work just fine.
 One example for such a case is the command 
\family typewriter
ReferencedFile latex "$$AbsOrRelPathMaster$$Basename.pstex_t"
\family default
 in the XFig template above: We can't use the absolute name because the
 copier for 
\family typewriter
.pstex_t
\family default
 files needs the relative name in order to rewrite the file content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Security discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
This section is outdated
\end_layout

\end_inset

The external material feature interfaces with a lot of external programs
 and does so automatically, so we have to consider the security implications
 of this.
 In particular, since you have the option of including your own filenames
 and/or parameter strings and those are expanded into a command, it seems
 that it would be possible to create a malicious document which executes
 arbitrary commands when a user views or prints the document.
 This is something we definately want to avoid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, since the external program commands are specified in the template
 configuration file only, there are no security issues if LyX is properly
 configured with safe templates only.
 This is so because the external programs are invoked with the 
\family typewriter
execvp
\family default
-system call rather than the 
\family typewriter
system
\family default
 system-call, so it's not possible to execute arbitrary commands from the
 filename or parameter section via the shell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This also implies that you are restricted in what command strings you can
 use in the external material templates.
 In particular, pipes and redirection are not readily available.
 This has to be so if LyX should remain safe.
 If you want to use some of the shell features, you should write a safe
 script to do this in a controlled manner, and then invoke the script from
 the command string.
 In the 
\family typewriter
lib/scripts
\family default
 directory of the LyX installation, you can find a safe wrapper script 
\family typewriter
general_command_wrapper.py
\family default
 that supports redirection of input and output.
 That can serve as an example for how to write safe template scripts.
 For a more advanced example that uses 
\family typewriter
fork
\family default
 and friends, take a look at the 
\family typewriter
pic2ascii.py
\family default
 converter script.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to design a template that interacts directly with the shell,
 but since this would allow a malicious user to execute arbitrary commands
 by writing clever filenames and/or parameters, we generally recommend that
 you only use safe scripts that work with the 
\family typewriter
execvp
\family default
 system call in a controlled manner.
 Of course, for use in a controlled environment, it can be tempting to just
 fall back to use ordinary shell scripts.
 If you do so, be aware that you 
\emph on
will
\emph default
 provide an easily exploitable security hole in your system.
 Of course it stands to reason that such unsafe templates will never be
 included in the standard LyX distribution, although we do encourage people
 to submit new templates in the open source tradition.
 But LyX as shipped from the official distribution channels will never have
 unsafe templates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Including external material provides a lot of power, and you have to be
 careful not to introduce security hazards with this power.
 A subtle error in a single line in an innocent looking script can open
 the door to huge security problems.
 So if you do not fully understand the issues, we recommend that you consult
 a knowledgable security professional or the LyX development team if you
 have any questions about whether a given template is safe or not.
 And do this before you use it in an uncontrolled environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
The LyX Server
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LyX server is a method implemented in LyX that will enable other programs
 to talk to LyX, invoke LyX commands, and retrieve information about the
 LyX internal state.
 This is only intended for advanced users, but they should find it useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Starting the LyX Server
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LyX server works through the use of a pair of named pipes.
 These are usually located in your home directory and have the names 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
.lyxpipe.in
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
.lyxpipe.out
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 External programs write into 
\family typewriter
.lyxpipe.in
\family default
 and read back data from 
\family typewriter
.lyxpipe.out
\family default
.
 The stem of the pipe names can be defined in the 
\family sans
\bar under
T
\bar default
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
P
\bar default
references
\family default
 dialog, for example 
\family typewriter
"/home/myhome/.lyxpipe"
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX will add the '
\family typewriter
.in
\family default
' and '
\family typewriter
.out
\family default
' to create the pipes.
 The above setting also has the effect of activating the LyX server.
 If one of the pipes already exists, LyX will assume that another LyX process
 is already running and will not start the server.
 To have several LyX processes with servers at the same time, you have to
 change the configuration between the start of the programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are developing a client program, you might find it useful to enable
 debugging information from the LyX server.
 Do this by starting LyX as 
\family typewriter
lyx -dbg lyxserver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Warning: if LyX crashes, it may not manage to remove the pipes; in this
 case you must remove them manually.
 If LyX starts and the pipes exist already, it will not start any server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than this, there are a few points to consider:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Both server and clients must run on UNIX or OS/2 machines.
 Communications between LyX on UNIX and clients on OS/2 or vice versa is
 not possible right now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On OS/2, only one client can connect to LyXServer at a time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On OS/2, clients must open inpipe with 
\family typewriter
O_WRONLY
\family default
 mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can find a complete example client written in C in the source distribution
 as 
\family typewriter
development/server_monitor.c
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Normal communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To issue a LyX call, the client writes a line of ASCII text into the input
 pipe.
 This line has the following format:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
LYXCMD:
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
:
\emph on
function
\emph default
:
\emph on
argument
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
 is a name that the client can choose arbitrarily.
 Its only use is that LyX will echo it if it sends an answer - so a client
 can dispatch results from different requesters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
function
\emph default
 is the function you want LyX to perform.
 It is the same as the commands you'd use in the minibuffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
argument
\emph default
 is an optional argument which is meaningful only to some functions (for
 instance 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self-insert
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which will insert the argument as text at the cursor position.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The answer from LyX will arrive in the output pipe and be of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
INFO:
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
:
\emph on
function
\emph default
:
\emph on
data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
function
\emph default
 are just echoed from the command request, while 
\emph on
data
\emph default
 is more or less useful information filled according to how the command
 execution worked out.
 Some commands will return information about the internal state of LyX,
 such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

font-state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, while other will return an empty data-response.
 This means that the command execution went fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case of errors, the response from LyX will have this form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
ERROR:
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
:
\emph on
function
\emph default
:
\emph on
error message
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the 
\emph on
error message
\emph default
 should contain an explanation of why the command failed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
echo "LYXCMD:test:beginning-of-buffer:" >~/.lyxpipe.in
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
echo "LYXCMD:test:get-xy:" >~/.lyxpipe.in
\newline
read a <~/.lyxpipe.out
\newline
echo $a
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Notification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX can notify clients of events going on asynchronously.
 Currently it will only do this if the user binds a key sequence with the
 function 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

notify
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The format of the string LyX sends is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\family typewriter
NOTIFY:
\family default
\emph on
key-sequence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\emph on
key-sequence
\emph default
 is the printed representation of the key sequence that was actually typed
 by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This mechanism can be used to extend LyX's command set and implement macros:
 bind some key sequence to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

notify
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, start a client that listens on the out pipe, dispatches the command according
 to the sequence and starts a function that may use LyX calls and LyX requests
 to issue a command or a series of commands to LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The simple LyX Server Protocol
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX implements a simple protocol that can be used for session management.
 All messages are of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
LYXSRV:
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
:
\emph on
protocol message
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\emph on
protocol message
\emph default
 can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hello
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bye
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hello
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is received from a client, LyX will report back to inform the client that
 it's listening to it's messages, while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bye
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sent from LyX will inform clients that LyX is closing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
\start_of_appendix
Bindings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This appendix is a huge cross-reference to all the English language keybindings.
 Originally, we simply wanted to list all of the key bindings followed by
 the function it's bound to.
 That way, a user can look up a key to find out what it does.
 We then decided, what the hey, why not include the default toolbar and
 menu bindings, too.
 Please note this section is likely to be very out of date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The form is really self-explanatory, but here are a few tips: all entries
 are arranged roughly alphabetically for a given modifier (
\family sans
C-a
\family default
, 
\family sans
C-b
\family default
, etc.).
 For the general keyboard layout, simpler prefixes precede the more complex
 (
\family sans
C-s
\family default
 before 
\family sans
C-S-c
\family default
).
 All entries were gleaned from the default user interface and binding files
 located in the directories 
\family typewriter
\SpecialChar \ldots{}
/share/lyx/ui
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
\SpecialChar \ldots{}
/share/lyx/bind
\family default
; they should be treated as the final word on the bindings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a final note, be aware that some window managers (such as FVWM) take
 control of some of the function keys or motion keys.
 
\family sans
C-right
\family default
 is listed here as generating 
\family typewriter
word-forward
\family default
, but FVWM grabs it and uses it to change virtual desktops instead.
 Very annoying unless you instruct your window manager to stop intercepting
 such sequences.

\begin_layout Standard
These are LyX keyboard definitions for mathematics, similar to those of
 Scientific Word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bindings file and the present documentation were prepared by Serge Winitzki
 with assistance from Jean-Marc Lasgouttes.
 Version 1.3, for LyX 1.2.x and 1.3.x.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These definitions make it a lot easier to type equations without using the
 mouse, especially for people familiar with Scientific Word.
 The standard LyX bindings such as 
\family typewriter
M-m
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
M-o
\family default
 are unmodified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tip: to find the "LyX bind name" for a key, look at the status bar after
 typing some non-existent key combination.
 E.g.
 to find how "Ctrl-&" is referenced, press Ctrl-S and then Ctrl-&: the status
 bar shows "C-s S-C-ampersand." (This does not work in LyX 1.3.0!)
