\begin_layout Standard
This file describes the different LaTeX add-ons that LyX can handle.
 Below you'll find six sections:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some basic details about your LaTeX installation.
 In particular, you should make sure that your version of LaTeX is recent
 enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some common fonts that LyX knows about.
 This is rather sparse at the moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The document classes that should be standard on any LaTeX implementation.
 This section is only here for completeness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some optional document classes that LyX knows about.
 If one of these is marked as missing (the

 Note that only detected document classes can be selected as document layouts
 in LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The packages that have been stamped 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

required
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by the LaTeX maintainers.
 These ones should definitely be present, but you may not have some of them
 if your LaTeX distribution is a bit old.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some packages that LyX uses when you try to change the margins of your document.
 The detection of these items does not yet affect the options available
 inside LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some common LaTeX packages that you might need with LyX, and you might also
 want to add to your LaTeX installation.
 The detection of these items does not yet affect the options available
 inside LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that most of these packages will be available if you use a modern TeX
 distribution such as teTeX.
 If you decide to install one of the missing items, you should tell LyX
 about it.
 After the installation, please use the menu entry 
\family sans
\bar under
T
\bar default
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
R

econfigure

or, if you want to change the system-wide settings, issue the command 
\family typewriter
./configure
\family default
 from the LyX system directory (by default 
\family typewriter
/usr/local/lib/lyx/
\family default
)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and reload this file to see if the new package was recognized.
 If the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Found
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items read 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

???
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, it means that LyX could not do the inventory of your LaTeX configuration
 for some reason.
 If you are using teTeX, it might be that the new package you installed
 is not found.
 This is because you forgot to run the command 
\family typewriter
texhash
\family default
, which tells teTeX to update its own configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
LaTeX version currently in use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LaTeX version that LyX will use is: 
\family typewriter
@chk_fmtversion@
\family default
.
 Note that, for best results, you should be using at least LaTeX release
 
\family typewriter
1995/12/01
\family default

\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
In case it is not clear to you, this number is the date at which the version
 has been released.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In fact, earlier versions may work for many things, but will certainly
 fail in some cases.
 We feel that it is better to stick to a minimal version than try to work
 around all the quirks of older ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\begin_layout Subsection
EC fonts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\begin_layout Description
CTAN:

fonts/ec

\begin_layout Description
Notes: LaTeX does not require the use of 
\family sans
ec
\family default
 fonts, however they are strongly recommended.
 The 
\family sans
ec
\family default
 fonts are available in a more natural range of sizes and allow better hyphenati
on and kerning than the old fonts such as 
\family sans
cmr10
\family default
.
 If you already have the so-called 
\family sans
dc
\family default
 fonts installed, please upgrade to the 
\family sans
ec
\family default
 fonts, which replace them.
 They are used automatically if LyX determines that you have them installed.

 Even if LyX supports the deprecated packages as well, we recommend that
 you take care to have the newest ones installed.
