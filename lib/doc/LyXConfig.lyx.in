This file describes both the different LaTeX add-ons that LyX can handle

 Below you'll find the following sections:

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some basic details about your LaTeX installation.
 In particular, you should make sure that your version of LaTeX is recent
 enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some common fonts that LyX knows about.
 This is rather sparse at the moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The document classes that should be standard on any LaTeX implementation.
 This section is only here for completeness.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some common LaTeX packages that you might need with LyX, and you might also
 want to add to your LaTeX installation.
 The detection of these items does not yet affect the options available

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Different required external programs that LyX relies on.
 LyX to a large extent relies on other programs to do it's work, and some
 programs are required for LyX to be useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Different optional external programs that LyX can interact with.
 All of these are optional, and some you would want more than others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that most of these packages will be available if you use a modern TeX
 distribution such as teTeX.
 If you decide to install one of the missing items, you should tell LyX
 about it.
 After the installation, please use the menu entry

, it means that LyX could not do the inventory of your LaTeX configuration
 for some reason.
 If you are using teTeX, it might be that the new package you installed
 is not found.
 This is because you forgot to run the command 
\family typewriter
texhash
\family default
, which tells teTeX to update its own configuration.

\begin_layout Section
LaTeX version currently in use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LaTeX version that LyX will use is:

 In fact, earlier versions may work for many things, but will certainly
 fail in some cases.
 We feel that it is better to stick to a minimal version than try to work
 around all the quirks of older ones.

Required external programs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX is eager to invoke external programs to do some work.
 In line with the Unix tradition, LyX tries to exploit existing programs
 before implementing the same thing itself.
 Over time, LyX is able to interact with an increasing number of both command
 line and interactive applications, and this to a large degree explains
 why LyX is succesful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: if you use a Linux distribution, such as RedHat or Debian, most of
 these packages should be available as custom packages for the relevant
 system, and you might have most of it installed already.
 And most Unix systems will at least have LaTeX, although it may be a braindead
 version.
 Please check what you have before you go download the lot.
