Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Welcome to LyX!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This file is designed for all of you who have never heard of LaTeX, or don't
 know it very well.
 Now, don't panic - you won't need to learn LaTeX to use LyX.
 That is, after all, the whole point of LyX: to provide an almost-WYSIWYG
 interface to LaTeX.
 There are some things you will need to learn, however, in order to use
 LyX effectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of you probably found your way to this document because you tried to
 put two spaces after a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or tried to put 3 blank lines between paragraphs.
 You found out you couldn't and in fact, you'll find out that most of the
 little tricks you're accustomed to use in other word processors won't work
 in LyX.
 That's because most word processors you've used before allow you to manually
 enter all spacings, font changes, and so on.
 So you end up not only writing a document but typesetting it, too.
 LyX does the typesetting for you, in a consistent fashion, letting you
 focus on the important things, like the content of your writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So read on to learn more about LyX.
 Reading this tutorial is definitely worth the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What the Tutorial 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 and what it 
\emph on
isn't
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we get started with this section, we want to make a quick note of
 something.
 The 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 uses the notation outlined in the 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 manual.
 If you came to this manual first, please read the 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 before you continue with the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that you know which fonts mean what, we want to talk a bit about what
 this 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 is for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Getting the most out of the Tutorial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial consists of examples and exercises.
 To get the most out of this document, you should read through the document,
 typing all the little things we're telling you to type and trying out all
 of the exercises to see if you get them right.
 For convenience, you might want to print out the PDF version of this document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are familiar with LaTeX, you'll probably be able to read the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 somewhat faster, since many LyX ideas are just LaTeX ideas in disguise.
 However, LyX have features you'll want to learn about.
 Even if you don't feel like reading the rest of the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
, you should definitely check out Section
\begin_inset space ~

OK\SpecialChar \@.
 You're ready to start writing.
 Before you do, there are a few things we need to mention, which will hopefully
 make the Tutorial more instructive and useful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because there are informations we can't give you in the Tutorial, the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 
\series medium
thing that you need to do is find the
\series default
 other 
\series medium
help files.
 This is very simple:
\series default
 Start up LyX, Choose the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 from the 
\family sans
Help
\family default
 menu.
 You may want to load the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 as well (if you're not reading it within LyX already).
 This way, you can read them while you're writing your own file.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
They can also serve as good examples of how to use the many features of
 LyX.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Note that once you've got more than one document open, you can use the
 
\family sans
View
\family default
 menu or the document tabs to switch between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this Tutorial, we're going to assume that you have a fully working version
 of LyX, as well as a LaTeX-distribution, a DVI-, and a PDF-viewer.
 This should be the case on all major Linux- and BSD-distribution, as well
 as on Windows, where this is setup by the LyX installer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we've written a file to let you practice your LyX skills on, it's
 called 
\family typewriter
example_raw.lyx
\family default
.
 Imagine that it was typed by someone who didn't know about any of LyX's
 great features.
 As you learn new LyX functions, we'll suggest that you fix those parts
 of 
\family typewriter
example_raw.lyx
\family default
.
 It also contains 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subtle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 hints about how to fix things.

 Access the text in a note by clicking on it.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 If you want to cheat, or check what you've done, there's also a file called
 
\family typewriter
example_lyxified.lyx
\family default
 which contains the same text written and typeset by a LyX master.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The example files can be found in the 
\family typewriter
examples
\family default
 directory of LyX's installation folder.
 Open the raw document, and use 
\family sans
File\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Save
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

As
\family default
 to save a copy in your own directory for you to work on.
 As you fix parts of the raw document, check to see how those changes affect
 the DVI output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the way, the 
\family typewriter
examples
\family default
 directory contains lots of other examples files.
 They will show you how to do various fancy things with LyX.
 After you read the Tutorial, or when you're confused about how to do something
 fancy in LyX, take a look at these files.

\begin_layout Standard
Congratulations! You've written your first LyX document.
 All of the rest is just details, which is covered in the other manuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Simple Operations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX can of course do most of the things you're used to do with a word processor.
 It will word-wrap and indent paragraphs automatically.
 Here's a quick description of how to do some simple actions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Undo LyX has multiple levels of undo, which means you can undo everything
 you've done since your current editing session started, by selecting 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Undo
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/undo.png
	scale 75

\end_inset

) over and over again.
 If you undo too much, just select 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Redo
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/redo.png
	scale 75

\end_inset

) to get it back.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Currently, undo is limited to 100 steps.
 Undo also doesn't work for 
\emph on
everything
\emph default
; for instance, not for changes to the document layout what is really a
 LyX bug.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Cut/Paste/Copy Use 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Cut
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/cut.png
	scale 75

\end_inset

), 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Copy
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/copy.png
	scale 75

\end_inset

), and 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Paste
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/paste.png
	scale 75

\end_inset

) to cut, copy, and paste.
 Or automatically paste selected text (including selections from other programs)
 with the 
\emph on
middle mouse button
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Find/Replace Use 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Find
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

&
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Replace
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/dialog-show_findreplace.png
	scale 75

\end_inset

) to search.
 In the dialog, search with the 
\family sans
Find
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Next
\family default
 button, and use the 
\family sans
Replace
\family default
 button to replace a word you've found.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Close the window when you're done or leave it open if you find it more convenien
t.
 Most dialog boxes in LyX can operate like this.
 Just be sure you have the right window focus when you're trying to type
 in the main LyX window or a LyX dialog.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 If you like, you can specify whether to make the search case-sensitive,
 or to search for only complete words; you can also search backwards through
 the document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Formatting You can 
\emph on
emphasize

 text (which will by default print characters in italics), set it in 
\series bold
bold face
\series default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Toolbar There are buttons on the toolbar (just below the menus) which allow
 you to do some of the more popular functions, such as 
\family sans
Paste
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Print
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, you haven't yet written enough to make most of these functions
 useful.
 As you write more, though, try undoing, pasting, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
WYSIWYM: Whitespace in LyX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the hardest things for new users to get used to is the way that LyX
 handles whitespace.
 As many times as you hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
, you'll only get one blank line.
 As many times as you hit 
\family sans
Space
\family default
, you'll only get one space.
 On a blank line, LyX won't let you type even one space.
 The 
\family sans
Tab
\family default
 key won't move you forward one tab stop; in fact there 
\emph on
are
\emph default
 no tab stops! There's no ruler at the top of the page to let you set tabs
 or margins, either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many word processors are based on the WYSIWYG principle: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You Get.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 LyX, on the other hand, is based on the principle that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You 
\emph on
Mean
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 You type what you mean, and LyX will take care of typesetting it for you,
 so that the output looks nice.
 A 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 grammatically separates paragraphs, and a 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 grammatically separates words, so there is no reason to have several of
 them in a row; a 
\family sans
Tab
\family default
 has no grammatical function at all, so LyX does not support it.
 Using LyX, you'll spend more of your time worrying about the 
\emph on
content
\emph default
 of your document, and less time worrying about the 
\emph on
format.

\emph default
 See the 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 for more information on the WYSIWYM concept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX does have (many) ways to fine-tune the formatting of your document.
 After all, LyX might not typeset 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 what you mean.
 The 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 has information about all that.
 It includes 
\family sans
HFill
\family default
s and vertical space — which are more powerful and versatile than multiple
 spaces or blank lines — and ways to change font sizes, character styles,
 and paragraph alignments by hand.
 The idea, though, is that you can write your whole document, focusing on
 content, and just worry about that fine-tuning at the end.
 With standard word processors, you'll be distracted by document formatting
 throughout the writing process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Environments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different parts of a document have different purposes; we call these parts
 
\emph on
environments
\emph default
.
 Most of a document is made up of regular text.
 Section titles (chapter, subsection, etc.) let the reader know that a new
 topic or subtopic will be discussed.
 Certain types of documents have special environments.
 A journal article will have an abstract and a title.
 A letter will have neither of these, but will probably have an environment
 that gives the writer's address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Environments are a major part of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You Mean
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 philosophy of LyX.
 A given environment may require a certain font style, font size, indenting,
 line spacing, and more.
 This problem is aggravated, because the exact formatting for a given environmen
t may change: one journal may use boldface, 18 point, centered type for
 section titles while another uses italicized, 15 point, left justified
 type; different languages may have different standards for indenting; and
 bibliography formats can vary widely.
 LyX lets you avoid learning all the different formatting styles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Environment
\family default
 choice box is located on the left end of the toolbar and looks like this:
 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename clipart/ToolbarEnvBox.png
	scale 75
	clip

\end_inset

.
 It indicates which environment you're currently writing in.
 While you were writing your first document, it said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Standard,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is the default environment for text.
 Now you will put a number of environments in your new document so that
 you can see how they work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sections and Subsections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Type the word 
\family typewriter

 on the first line of your LyX file, and select 
\family sans

 in the 
\family sans

\family default
 box.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
You don't have to 
\emph on
select
\emph default

 If nothing is selected, LyX changes the paragraph you are currently in
 to the selected environment.
 Alternatively, you can change several paragraphs to a different environment
 by selecting them before picking an environment.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Be sure to use 
\family sans
Section
\family default
 and 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 
\family sans

 LyX numbers the section 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and typesets the section heading (title) in a larger font.
 Now hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
\SpecialChar \@.
 Note that the 
\family sans

\family default

\end_inset

Section
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 back to

\end_inset

Standard
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Section headings, like most environments, are assumed to end when you type
 
\family sans
Return
\family default
\SpecialChar \@.
 Type the document introduction: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout Standard
Hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 again, and select

 LyX writes a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 and waits for you to type a title.
 Type

\end_inset


\family typewriter
More
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Stuff
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and you'll see that LyX again sets it as a section title.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It gets better.
 Go to the end of Section

\end_inset

1 again (after 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

) and hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default

\family default
 box again.
 Again, LyX writes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

3! In true WYSIWYM fashion, you just need to identify the text that makes
 up the section titles, and LyX takes care of numbering the sections and
 typesetting them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 to get back to the

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Click on the second line and select 
\family sans
Subsection
\family default
 from the 
\family sans
Environment
\family default
 box.
 LyX numbers the subsection 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

2.1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and typesets it in a font which is bigger than regular text but smaller
 than the section title.
 Change the fourth line 
\family sans
Subsection
\family default

 As you probably expected, LyX automatically numbered the section 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

.
 If you put yet another section before Section
\begin_inset space ~

Finally, you may want to have sections or subsections that are not numbered.

 If you change one of your section headings to the

Lists and sublists

\begin_layout Standard
LyX has several different environments for typesetting lists.
 The various list environments free you from hitting 
\family sans
Tab
\family default
 a million times when writing an outline, or from renumbering a whole list
 when you want to add a point in the middle of the list.
 Different types of documents logically require different list environments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A slide presentation might use the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment's bulleted lists to describe different points.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An outline would use the 
\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

List environments, unlike headings, do not end when you type

 Instead, LyX assumes you're going on to the next item in the list.
 The above will therefore result in a three-item list.
 If you want more than one paragraph within one list

\begin_layout Chapter
Writing Documents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous chapter hopefully allowed you to get used to writing in LyX.
 It introduced you to the basic editing operations in LyX, as well as the
 powerful method of writing with environments.
 Most people who use LyX, though, will want to write documents: papers,
 articles, books, manuals, or letters.
 This chapter is meant to take you from simply writing text with LyX to
 writing a complete document.
 It will introduce you to text classes, which allow you to write different
 sorts of documents.
 It will then describe many of the additions that turn text into a document,
 such as titles, footnotes, cross references, bibliographies, and tables
 of contents.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different sorts of documents should be typeset differently.
 For example, books are generally printed double-sided, while articles are
 single-sided.
 In addition, many documents contain special environments: letters contain
 some environments — such as the sender's address and the signature — which
 do not make sense in a book or article.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 takes care of these large scale differences between different sorts of
 documents.
 This Tutorial, for example, was written in the 
\family sans
Book
\family default
 document class.
 Document classes are another major part of the WYSIWYM philosophy; they
 tell LyX how to typeset the document, so you don't need to know how.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family sans

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Try changing to other document classes (using the

 If you change your document to the 
\family sans
Book

\family sans
Environment
\family default
 box, you'll see that most of the allowed environments are the same.
 However, you can now use the 
\family sans

 environment.
 If you are ever unsure about which environments you can use in a given
 document class, just consult the 
\family sans

 box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Font sizes, one- or two-column printing, and page headings are just some
 of the ways journals' typesettings differ from one another.
 As the Computer Age continues to mature, journals have begun accepting
 electronic submissions, creating LaTeX 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

style files
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so that authors can submit correctly typeset articles.
 LyX is set up to support this as well.
 For example, LyX supports typesetting (and extra environments) for the
 American Mathematics Society journals using the 
\family sans
Article

\begin_layout Section
Templates: Writing a Letter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to write a letter would be to open a new file, and choose a 
\family sans
Letter
\family default
 class in the 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Settings
\family default
 dialog.
 While this is the most obvious way to write a letter, it seems like extra
 work.
 Every time you write a business letter, you want to have your address,
 the address you're sending to, a body, a signature, etc.
 LyX therefore has a 
\emph on
template
\emph default
 for letters, which contains a sample letter; once you have a template,
 you can just replace a couple parts of the letter with your text each time
 you write a letter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open a new file with 
\family sans
File\SpecialChar \menuseparator
New
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

from
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Template
\family default
.
 Select 
\family typewriter
letter.lyx
\family default
 as the template.
 Save and print the file to see how the various environments are typeset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you look at the 
\family sans
Environment
\family default
 box, you'll see several environments, like the 
\family sans
My
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Address
\family default
 environment, which don't even exist in most other document classes.
 Others, like 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Description
\family default
, are familiar.
 You can play around for a while to figure out how the various environments
 work.
 You'll notice for example that the 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 environment has the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Signature:
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 in red before the actual text of the signature.
 This word doesn't show up in the actual letter, as you'll see if you view/expor
t the file.
 It's just there to let you know where the signature goes.
 Also, note that it doesn't matter where in the file the 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 line is placed.
 Remember, LyX is WYSIWYM; you can put the 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 environment anywhere you want, but LyX knows that in the printout, the
 signature should be at the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A template is just a regular LyX file.
 This means you can fill in your address and signature and save the file
 as a new template.
 From now on, any time you want to write a letter, you can use the new template
 to save time.
 We don't have to suggest an actual 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 here; just write a letter to someone!
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One warning, if you're writing from a template.
 If you erase all of the text in an environment — for example, if you erase
 the whole 
\family sans
My
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Address
\family default
 field so that you can replace it with your own — and then you move the
 cursor without writing any text, the environment may disappear.
 This is because most environments cannot exist without any text in them.
 Just reselect the environment from the 
\family sans
Environment
\family default
 box to get it back.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Templates can be a huge time-saver, and we urge you to use them whenever
 possible.
 In addition, they can help a person learn how to use some of the fancier
 document classes.
 Finally, they may be useful for a person who is configuring LyX for a bunch
 of less computer-aware users.
 When they're first learning LyX, it will be much less intimidating if they
 have a letter template customized for their company, for example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Document Titles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX (like LaTeX) considers the title — which may contain the actual title,
 the author, the date, and even an abstract of a paper — to be a separate
 part of the document.

 Once you do so, you can refer to this section in other parts of the document,

 You can refer either to the section's number, or to the page that the section

 As with section numbering, LyX also takes care about cross-reference numbering
 for you.
 Automatic labels and cross-references are one of the best advantages of
 LyX (and LaTeX) over conventional word processors.

By the way, you could have put the label right anywhere within the section
 as well; section references will refer to the last section or subsection
 whose heading comes before the label.
 However, putting it on the same line as the section title (or, perhaps,
 on the first line of the section's text) ensures that page references will
 reference the beginning of the section.

You may wonder why the footnote button is a word instead of a number.
 The answer is that LyX takes care about the footnote numbering for you
 in the printed text.
 You can see this yourself by looking at the DVI file (or printout).
 If you add other footnotes, LyX will renumber the footnotes.
 Since LyX (well, LaTeX, actually) takes care of the footnote numbering,
 there's really no need to put the numbers in the LyX file.

Using Math
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LaTeX is used by many scientists because it outputs great looking equations,
 avoiding the control characters used by word processors and their equation
 editors.
 Many of these scientists are frustrated, however, because writing equations
 in LaTeX is more like programming than writing.
 Happily, LyX has WYSIWYM support for equations.
 If you are used to LaTeX, you'll find that all of the usual LaTeX math
 commands can be typed in normally, but they will show up in a WYSIWYM fashion.
 If, on the other hand, you've never written in LaTeX, then the 
\family sans
Math
\begin_inset space ~

Panel
\family default
 will allow you to write professional-looking math quickly and easily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somewhere in your LyX document, type: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
I like what Einstein said, E=mc^2, because it's so simple.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, that equation doesn't look very good in LyX and in the output; there's
 no space between the letters and the equals sign, and you'd like to write
 an actual superscript for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That bad typesetting happened because we didn't tell LyX that we were writing
 a mathematical expression, so it typeset the equation like regular old
 text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead, we create a formula that will get typeset properly.
 In order to create a formula, just click the toolbar button 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/math-mode.png

 LyX will insert a little blue square, which is an empty math formula.
 Now just type

 again.
 The expression is typed in blue, and the blue square disappears as soon
 as the formula is not empty.
 Now type 
\family sans

\family default
 to leave the equation The purple markers disappear, leaving the cursor
 to the right of the expression, and now if you type something, it will
 be regular text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Run LaTeX and look at the output.
 Notice that the expression was typeset nicely, with spaces between the
 letters and the equals sign, and a superscript 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Letters in math mode are assumed to be variables, and come out in italics.
 Numbers are just numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This math editor is another example of the WYSIWYM philosophy.
 In LaTeX, you write a mathematical expression using text and commands like
 
\family typewriter

\backslash
sqrt
\family default
; this can be frustrating, because you can't see what an expression looks
 like until you LaTeX the file, and may have to spend time to find e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

missing brackets.
 LyX doesn't attempt to get the expression to look perfect (WYSIWYG), but
 it gives you an extremely good idea of what the expression will look like.
 LaTeX then takes care of the professional typesetting.

What if you want to change 
\begin_inset Formula $E=mc^{2}$

 Click on a decoration, and LyX will insert that decoration with an insertion

 Just type what you want in the insertion point.
 There are two sets of decorations: those that resize with the text you

 Your current selection of delimiters is displayed in a box.
 It's a pair of parentheses by default, but you can choose a pair of braces,

\begin_layout Subsection
Display mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of the expressions we have written so far have been on the same line
 as the text that came before and after them, otherwise known as inline
 expressions.
 This is fine for short, simple expressions, but if you want to write larger
 ones, or if you want your expressions to stand out from the text, you need
 to write them in display mode.
 In addition, only displayed expressions can be labeled and numbered (see
 the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
), and multi-line equations must be in display mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

 in the 
\family sans
Math
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Toolbar
\family default
, which represents a couple lines of text before and after a centered blue
 box.
 LyX inserts a formula, but the insertion point is on a new line, and it's
 centered within that line.
 Now type an expression and run LaTeX to see how it looks.
 The display button is actually a toggle; use it now to change a couple
 of your expressions to display mode and back.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Display mode has a couple differences from inline mode:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The default font is larger for a few symbols, like 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\int$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Subscripts and superscripts for limits and sums (but not integrals) are
 written under rather than next to the symbols
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Text is centered
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than these differences, though, displayed expressions and inline expressio
ns are very similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One final note about the way displayed formulas are typeset: Be careful
 about whether you're putting your equation into a new paragraph or not.
 If your formula is in the middle of a sentence or paragraph, then don't
 press 
\family sans
Return
\family default
.
 Doing so will cause the text 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 the formula to start a new paragraph.
 That text will therefore eventually be indented, depending on your document
 paragraph settings, which is probably not what you want.

 We'll just mention a couple more major things LyX can do:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX has WYSIWYM support for tables.
 Use the 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Table
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/tabular-insert.png

\emph default
 to get a 
\family sans
Table
\begin_inset space ~

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX also supports including pictures in any format within documents.
 (You guessed it: 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Graphics
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/dialog-show-new-inset_graphics.png
	scale 75
	scaleBeforeRotation

\end_inset

).
 Then browse for the figure file, rotate or scale it, etc.) Tables and figures
 can have captions, and LyX will automatically generate lists of figures
 and/or tables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX is heavily configurable.
 Everything from how the LyX window looks to how the output comes out can
 be configured in a number of ways.
 Much configuration is done through 
\family sans
Tools\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Preferences
\family default
.
 For more information on this, check out 
\family sans
Help\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Customization\SpecialChar \@.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX is being developed by a team of programmers on five continents.
 Therefore, LyX has better support for non-English languages (such as Dutch,
 German, French, Greek, Czech, Turkish, \SpecialChar \ldots{}
) than many word processors.
 Even the right-to-left languages Arabic, Farsi, and Hebrew and the Asian
 languages Chinese Japanese, and Korean are supported.
 You can write documents in other languages and you can also configure LyX
 to show its menus and error messages in other languages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The LyX menus feature keybindings.
 This means that you can do 
\family sans
File\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Open
\family default
 by pressing 
\family sans
M-F
\family default
 followed by 
\family sans

 or by using the binding which is shown next to it in the menu (C-O by default).
 Keybindings are also configurable.

If you don't know anything about LaTeX, you don't have to read this section.
 Actually, you might want to 
\emph on
learn
\emph default
 about LaTeX, and then read this chapter.
 However, some who begin to use LyX will be familiar with LaTeX.
 If you are such a person, you may be wondering if LyX can really do everything
 LaTeX can do.
 The short answer is that LyX can do pretty much everything LaTeX can do
 in one form or another, and it definitely simplifies most parts of writing
 a LaTeX document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because this is just a tutorial, we are only going to mention things that
 new LyX users will most likely be interested in.
 In the interests of keeping the Tutorial short, we will give only minimal
 information here.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
TeX Mode 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anything that you enter in TeX mode will be passed straight to LaTeX, and
 will be displayed in red on the screen.
 You can use TeX commands in LyX by choosing 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
TeX
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Code
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/ert-insert.png
	scale 75
	scaleBeforeRotation

\end_inset

).
 This creates a box where everything within it is passed straight to LaTeX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a math formula, TeX mode is handled a bit differently.
 TeX mode is there entered by typing a backslash.
 The backslash is not written out, but anything you type afterwards will
 be in red.
 You exit TeX mode by typing 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 or some other non-alphabetic character, like a number, underscore, caret,
 or parenthesis.
 Once you exit TeX mode, if LyX knows the TeX command you've typed in, it
 will convert it to WYSIWYM\SpecialChar \@.
 So if you type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
gamma
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a formula and then press 
\family sans
Space
\family default
, LyX will change the red 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gamma
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to a blue 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This will work for almost all, non-complicated math macros.
 This may be faster than using the 
\family sans
Math
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Toolbar
\family default
, and will be especially convenient for experienced LaTeX users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a special case, if you type a brace in TeX mode, then the beginning 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 ending braces will be inserted in red, then take you 
\emph on
out
\emph default
 of TeX mode and place the cursor between the braces.
 This makes it more convenient to type commands that LyX doesn't know which
 take an argument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX can't do absolutely everything that LaTeX can do.
 Some fancy functions are not supported at all, while some work but aren't
 WYSIWYM.
 TeX mode allows users to get the full flexibility of LaTeX, while having
 all the convenient features of LyX, like WYSIWYM math, tables, and editing.
 LyX could never support every LaTeX package.
 However, by typing 
\family typewriter

\backslash
usepackage{foo}
\family default
 in the preamble (see section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:preamble"

), you can use any package you want — although you won't have WYSIWYM support
 for that package's features.
