\begin_layout Section
Welcome to LyX!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This file is designed for all of you who have never heard of LaTeX, or don't
 know it very well.
 Now, don't panic - you won't need to learn LaTeX to use LyX.
 That is, after all, the whole point of LyX: to provide an almost-WYSIWYG
 interface to LaTeX.
 There are some things you will need to learn, however, in order to use
 LyX effectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of you probably found your way to this document because you tried to
 put two spaces after a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or tried to put 3 blank lines between paragraphs.
 After much frustration, you found you couldn't.
 In fact, you'll find that most of the little tricks you're accustomed to
 using in other word processors just won't work in LyX.
 That's because most word processors you've used before allow you to manually
 enter all spacings, font changes, and so on.
 So you end up not only writing a document but typesetting it, too.
 LyX does the typesetting for you, in a consistent fashion, letting you
 focus on the important things, like the content of your writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, bear with us and read on.
 Reading this tutorial is definitely worth the time.

What the Tutorial 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 and What it 
\emph on
isn't
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we get started with this section, we want to make a quick note of
 something.
 The 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 uses the notation outlined in the 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
\SpecialChar \@.
 If you came to this manual first, go read the 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
\SpecialChar \@.
 Yes, we mean now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that you know which fonts mean what, we want to talk a bit about what
 this 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 is for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Getting the Most out of the Tutorial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial consists of examples and exercises.
 To get the most out of this document, you should read through the document,
 typing all the silly little things we're telling you to type and trying
 out all of the exercises to see if you get them right.
 For convenience, you might want to print out the PostScript® version of
 this document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are familiar with LaTeX, you'll probably be able to read the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 somewhat faster, since many LyX ideas are just LaTeX ideas in disguise.
 However, LyX does have idiosyncrasies

Seriously, though, we're here to get you up and running so that all you

 If we tried to duplicate all of the information about all of LyX's features

 OK\SpecialChar \@.
 You're ready to start writing.
 Before you do, though, there are a few things we need to mention, which
 will hopefully make the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 more instructive, useful, and fun.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because there's lots of information that we won't be giving you, the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 
\series medium
thing that you need to do is find the
\series default
 other 
\series medium
help files.
 Luckily, this is very simple.

\series default
 Start up LyX.
 Choose the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 from the 
\family sans
\bar under
H
\bar default
elp
\family default
 menu.
 You may want to load the 
\emph on

\emph default
 as well (if you're not reading it on screen already).
 This way, you can read them while you're writing your own file
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
They can also serve as good examples of how to use the many features of
 LyX.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Note that once you've got more than one document open, you can use the
 
\family sans
\bar under
V
\bar default
iew
\family default
 menu or the document tabs to switch between them.
 The 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 will not cover in detail subjects which are described in the other LyX
 manuals.
 This may make life a bit harder for you at the beginning, but it will keep
 the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 short.
 It will also get you in the habit of using the other manuals, which ---
 in the long run --- will save you a lot of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
, we're going to assume that you have a fully working version of LyX, as
 well as LaTeX, 
\family typewriter
xdvi
\family default
 or some other dvi viewer, 
\family typewriter
dvips
\family default
 or some other way of converting 
\family typewriter
dvi
\family default
 documents to PostScript® documents, and a working printer.
 This is a lot to assume.
 If any of this is not true, you (or a friendly system administrator) will
 need to set up your system.
 You can find information on setup in other manuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we've written a file to let you practice your LyX skills on.
 It's called 
\family typewriter
example_raw.lyx
\family default
.
 Imagine that it was typed by someone who didn't know about any of LyX's
 great features.
 As you learn new LyX functions, we'll suggest that you fix those parts
 of 
\family typewriter
example_raw.lyx
\family default
.
 It also contains 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\end_inset

 If you want to cheat (or check what you've done), there's also a file called
 
\family typewriter
example_lyxified.lyx
\family default
 which contains the same text as written and typeset by a LyX master.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The example files can be found in the

 As you fix parts of the raw document, check to see how those changes affect
 the dvi output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the way, the 
\family typewriter
examples/
\family default
 directory contains lots of other examples files.
 They will show you how to do various fancy things with LyX.
 They are especially useful to display things that (due to length or other
 reasons) won't fit in the documentation.
 After you read the

 look at these files.

\begin_layout Subsection
Simple Operations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX can of course do most of the things you're used to doing with a word
 processor.
 It will word-wrap and indent paragraphs automatically.
 Here's a quick description of how to do some simple actions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Undo LyX has multiple levels of undo, which means you can undo everything
 you've done since your current editing session started, by selecting 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
U
\bar default
ndo
\family default
 over and over again.
 If you undo too much, just select 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
R
\bar default
edo
\family default
 to get it back.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Currently, undo is limited to 100 steps.
 Undo also doesn't work for 
\emph on
everything
\emph default
; for instance, changes to the document layout.
 Each of these is really a LyX bug.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Cut/Paste/Copy Use 
\family sans

dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Cut
\family default

dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Copy
\family default
, and 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Paste
\family default
 to cut, copy, and paste.
 Or automatically paste selected text (including selections from other programs)
 with the 
\emph on

 A few dialogs, like

, won't let you type anything in the main LyX window until you actually
 close the dialog.
 Just be sure you have the right window focus when you're trying to type
 in the main LyX window or give a command in some other LyX dialog.
\end_layout

 If you like, you can specify whether to make the search case-sensitive,
 or to search for only complete words; you can also search backwards through
 the document.

Toolbar There are buttons on the toolbar (just below the menus) which allow
 you to do some of the more popular functions, such as 
\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, you haven't yet written enough to make most of these functions
 useful.
 As you write more, though, try undoing, pasting, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
WYSIWYM: Whitespace in LyX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand label
name "sec:whitespace"

\end_inset

One of the hardest things for new users to get used to is the way that LyX
 handles whitespace.
 As many times as you hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
, you'll only get one blank line.
 As many times as you hit 
\family sans
Space
\family default
, you'll only get one space.
 On a blank line, LyX won't let you type even one space.
 The 
\family sans
Tab
\family default
 key won't move you forward one tab stop; in fact there 
\emph on
are
\emph default
 no tab stops! There's no ruler at the top of the page to let you set tabs
 or margins, either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many commercial word processors are based on the WYSIWYG principle: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You Get.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 LyX, on the other hand, is based on the principle that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You 
\emph on
Mean
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 You type what you mean, and LyX will take care of typesetting it for you,
 so that the output looks nice.
 A 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 grammatically separates paragraphs, and a 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 grammatically separates words, so there is no reason to have several of
 them in a row; a 
\family sans
Tab
\family default
 has no grammatical function at all, so LyX does not support it.
 Using LyX, you'll spend more of your time worrying about the 
\emph on
content
\emph default
 of your document, and less time worrying about the 
\emph on
format.

\emph default
 See the 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 for more information on the WYSIWYM concept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX does have (many) ways to fine-tune the formatting of your document.
 After all, LyX might not typeset 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 what you mean.
 The 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 has information about all that.
 It includes 
\family sans
HFill
\family default
s and vertical space --- which are more powerful and versatile than multiple
 spaces or blank lines --- and ways to change font sizes, character styles,
 and paragraph alignments by hand.
 The idea, though, is that you can write your whole document, focusing on
 content, and just worry about that fine-tuning at the end.
 With standard word processors, you'll be distracted by document formatting
 throughout the writing process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Environments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different parts of a document have different purposes; we call these parts
 
\emph on
environments
\emph default
.
 Most of a document is made up of regular text.
 Section (chapter, subsection, etc.) titles let the reader know that a new
 topic or subtopic will be discussed.
 Certain types of documents have special environments.
 A journal article will have an abstract, and a title.
 A letter will have neither of these, but will probably have an environment
 that gives the writer's address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Environments are a major part of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You Mean
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 philosophy of LyX.
 A given environment may require a certain font style, font size, indenting,
 line spacing, and more.
 This problem is aggravated, because the exact formatting for a given environmen
t may change: one journal may use boldface, 18 point, centered type for
 section titles while another uses italicized, 15 point, left justified
 type; different languages may have different standards for indenting; and
 bibliography formats can vary widely.
 LyX lets you avoid learning all the different formatting styles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Environment
\family default
 box is located on the left end of the toolbar (just under the 
\family sans
\bar under
F
\bar default
ile
\family default
 menu).
 It indicates which environment you're currently writing in.
 While you were writing your first document, it said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Standard,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is the default environment for text.
 Now you will put a number of environments in your new document so that
 you can see how they work.
 You'll do so with the 
\family sans
Environment
\family default
 menu, which you open by clicking on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Writing Documents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous chapter hopefully allowed you to get used to writing in LyX.
 It introduced you to the basic editing operations in LyX, as well as the
 powerful method of writing with environments.
 Most people who use LyX, though, will want to write documents: papers,
 articles, books, manuals, or letters.
 This chapter is meant to take you from simply writing text with LyX to
 writing a complete document.
 It will introduce you to text classes, which allow you to write different
 sorts of documents.
 It will then describe many of the additions that turn text into a document,
 such as titles, footnotes, cross references, bibliographies, and tables
 of contents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Text classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand label

\end_inset

Different sorts of documents should be typeset differently.
 For example, books are generally printed double-sided, while articles are
 single-sided.
 In addition, many documents contain special environments: letters contain
 some environments --- such as the sender's address and the signature ---
 which do not make sense in a book or article.
 The LyX

 takes care of these large scale differences between different sorts of
 documents.
 This 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
, for example, was written in the 
\family sans
Book
\family default
 text class.
 Text classes are another major part of the WYSIWYM philosophy; they tell
 LyX how to typeset the document, so you don't need to know how.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 If you change your document to the

\family sans

\family default
 menu, you'll see that most of the allowed environments are the same.
 However, you can now use the

 class, just consult the 
\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Font sizes, one- or two-column printing, and page headings are just some
 of the ways journals' typesettings differ from one another.
 As the Computer Age continues to mature, journals have begun accepting
 electronic submissions, creating LaTeX 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

style files
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so that authors can submit correctly typeset articles.
 LyX is set up to support this as well.
 For example, LyX supports typesetting (and extra environments) for the
 American Mathematics Society journals using the 
\family sans
Article\InsetSpace ~
(AMS)
\family default
 text class.

\begin_layout Section
Templates: Writing a Letter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most popular text classes is 
\family sans
Letter
\family default
\SpecialChar \@.
 One way to write a letter would be to open a new file, and choose 
\family sans
Letter
\family default
 class in the 
\family sans
\bar under
D
\bar default
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
S
\bar default
ettings
\family default
 dialog.
 While this is the most obvious way to write a letter, it seems like extra
 work.
 Every time you write a business letter, you want to have your address,
 the address you're sending to, a body, a signature, etc.
 LyX therefore has a 
\emph on
template
\emph default
 for letters, which contains a sample letter; once you have a template,
 you can just replace a couple parts of the letter with your text each time
 you write a letter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open a new file with 
\family sans
\bar under
F
\bar default
ile\SpecialChar \menuseparator
New\InsetSpace ~

\bar under
T
\bar default
emplate
\family default
.
 Select 
\family typewriter
letter.lyx
\family default
 as the template.
 Save and print the file to see how the various environments are typeset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you look at the 
\family sans
Environment
\family default
 menu, you'll see several environments, like the 
\family sans
My\InsetSpace ~
Address
\family default
 environment, which don't even exist in most other text classes.
 Others, like 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Description
\family default
, are familiar.
 You can play around for a while to figure out how the various environments
 work.
 You'll notice for example that the 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 environment has the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Signature:
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 in red before the actual text of the signature.
 This word doesn't show up in the actual letter, as you'll see if you try
 printing the file.
 It's just there to let you know where the signature goes.
 Also, note that it doesn't matter where in the file the 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 line is placed.
 Remember, LyX is WYSIWYM; you can put the 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 environment anywhere you want, but LyX knows that in the printout, the
 signature should be at the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A template is just a regular LyX file.
 This means you can fill in your address and signature and save the file
 as a new template.
 From now on, any time you want to write a letter, you can use the new template
 to save time.
 We probably don't have to suggest an actual 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exercise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here; just write a letter to someone!
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Standard
One warning, if you're writing from a template.
 If you erase all of the text in an environment --- for example, if you
 erase the whole 
\family sans
My\InsetSpace ~
Address
\family default
 field so that you can replace it with your own --- and then you move the
 cursor without writing any text, the environment may disappear.
 This is because most environments cannot exist without any text in them.
 Just reselect the environment from the 
\family sans
Environment
\family default
 menu to get it back.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Templates can be a huge time-saver, and we urge you to use them whenever
 possible.
 In addition, they can help a person learn how to use some of the fancier
 text classes.
 Finally, they may be useful for a person who is configuring LyX for a bunch
 of less computer-aware users.
 When they're first learning LyX, it will be much less intimidating if they
 have a letter template customized for their company, for example.

\begin_layout Section
Document Titles

You can label a section (or subsubsection, or, more rarely, just a random
 piece of text) in your document.
 Once you do so, you can refer to this section in other parts of the document,
 using cross-references.
 You can refer either to the section's number, or to the page that the section
 appears on.
 As with sections and footnotes, LyX worries about the cross-references
 for you.
 Automatic labels and cross-references are one of the best advantages of
 LyX (and LaTeX) over conventional word processors.

By the way, you could have put the label right anywhere within the section

 However, putting it on the same line as the section title (or, perhaps,

 reference the beginning of the section.

You may wonder why the footnote button is a word instead of a number.
 The answer is that LyX worries about the footnote numbering for you in
 the printed text.
 You can see this yourself by looking at the

 If you add other footnotes, LyX will renumber the footnotes.
 Since LyX (well, LaTeX, actually) takes care of the footnote numbering,
 there's really no need to put the numbers in the LyX file.

Bibliographies (at least in the exact sciences) are similar to cross references.
 The bibliography contains a list of references at the end of the document,
 and they can be referenced from within the document.
 Like section titles, LyX and LaTeX make your job easier by automatically
 numbering the bibliography items and changing citations when the items'
 numbers change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go to the end of the document and switch to the

 Now, each paragraph you type will be a reference.
 Type 
\family typewriter

 as your first reference.
 Note that LyX automatically puts a number in a box before each reference.
 Click on the boxed reference number, and a 
\family sans

Using Math
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LaTeX is used by many scientists because it outputs great looking equations,
 avoiding the control characters used by word processors and their equation
 editors.
 Many of these scientists are frustrated, however, because writing equations
 in LaTeX is more like programming than writing.
 Happily, LyX has WYSIWYM support for equations.
 If you are used to LaTeX, you'll find that all of the usual LaTeX math
 commands can be typed in normally, but they will show up in a WYSIWYM fashion.
 If, on the other hand, you've never written in LaTeX, then the

Somewhere in your LyX document, type: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
I like what Einstein said, E=mc^2, because it's so simple.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, that equation doesn't look very good, even in the 
\family typewriter

 like to write an actual superscript for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That bad typesetting happened because we didn't tell LyX that we were writing
 a mathematical expression, so it typeset the equation like regular old
 text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead, we create a formula that will get typeset properly.
 In order to create a formula, just click the toolbar button with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{a+b}{c}$
\end_inset

 written on it in blue.
 LyX will insert a little blue square, which is an empty math formula.
 LyX has placed the cursor in the blue square, so just type 
\family typewriter
E=mc^2
\family default
 again.
 The expression is typed in blue, and the blue square disappears as soon
 as the formula is not empty.
 Now type 
\family sans

\family default
 to leave the equation The purple markers disappear, leaving the cursor
 to the right of the expression, and now if you type something, it will
 be regular text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Run LaTeX and look at the 
\family typewriter

 Notice that the expression was typeset nicely, with spaces between the
 letters and the equals sign, and a superscript 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Letters in math mode are assumed to be variables, and come out in italics.
 Numbers are just numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This math editor is another example of the WYSIWYM philosophy.
 In LaTeX, you write a mathematical expression using text and commands like
 
\family typewriter

\backslash
sqrt
\family default
; this can be frustrating, because you can't see what an expression looks
 like until you LaTeX the file, and may have to spend time to find missing
 brackets or other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bugs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, LyX doesn't attempt to get the expression to look perfect
 (WYSIWYG), but it gives you an extremely good idea of what the expression
 will look like.
 LaTeX then takes care of the professional typesetting.
 99% of the time, you won't have to make any changes to the font sizes or
 spacing that LaTeX outputs.
 This way (sorry to be so repetitive) you can focus on the

 The 
\family sans

\family default
 types are available from the panel.
 Click on a decoration, and LyX will insert that decoration with an insertion
 point under (or over) it.
 Just type what you want in the insertion point.
 There are two sets of decorations: those that resize with the text you
 type, and those that have fixed size, and are most appropriate for a single
 letter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Delimiters such as parentheses, brackets, and braces work similarly, but
 are a bit more complicated.
 Hit the 
\family sans

\family default
 button, which features a blue square surrounded by brackets, to pop up
 the 
\family sans

 Your current selection of delimiters is displayed in a box.
 It's a pair of parentheses by default, but you can choose a pair of braces,
 a brace and a parenthesis, or even choose the empty square to have something
 like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $a=\left\langle 7\right.$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the empty delimiter is displayed as a broken line in LyX, but won't show
 up in the output).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're lazy, you can type actual parentheses in math mode, rather than
 using the 
\family sans

\family default
 window.
 However, those parentheses will be the same size as regular text, which
 will look bad if you have a big fraction or matrix inside the parentheses.
 Using the 
\family sans

\family default
 window will guarantee that the delimiters are sized based on what's inside
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also put delimiters or a square root sign or a decoration on already
 existing text.
 Select the portion of the formula that you want to adjust, and then click

 in math mode, LyX thinks you're typing the product of the three variables
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 The three letters will be typeset in italics, when what you really wanted
 was the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sin
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 typeset in Roman.
 In addition, LyX won't put a space between the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sin

 and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 So how do you get 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\sin x$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead of

Display mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of the expressions we have written so far have been on the same line
 as the text that came before and after them, otherwise known as inline
 expressions.
 This is fine for short, simple expressions, but if you want to write larger
 ones, or if you want your expressions to stand out from the text, you need
 to write them in display mode.
 In addition, only displayed expressions can be labeled and numbered (see
 the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
), and multi-line equations (see Sec.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:multiline"

\end_inset

) must be in display mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Click on the 
\family sans
Display
\family default
 button in the 
\family sans
Math\InsetSpace ~
Panel
\family default
, which represents a couple lines of text before and after a centered blue
 box.
 LyX inserts a formula, but the insertion point is on a new line, and it's
 centered within that line.
 Now type an expression and run LaTeX to see how it looks.
 The 
\family sans
Display
\family default
 button is actually a toggle; use it now to change a couple of your expressions
 to display mode and back.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Display mode has a couple differences from inline mode:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The default font is larger for a few symbols, like 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\int$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Subscripts and superscripts for limits and sums (but not integrals) are
 written under rather than next to the symbols
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Text is centered
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than these differences, though, displayed expressions and inline expressio
ns are very similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One final note about the way displayed formulae are typeset: be careful
 about whether you're putting your equation into a new paragraph or not.
 If your formula is in the middle of a sentence or paragraph, then don't
 press 
\family sans
Return
\family default
.
 Doing so will cause the text 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 the formula to start a new paragraph.
 That text will therefore be indented, which is probably not what you want.

User's Guide
\emph default
 for more information.
 We'll just mention a couple more major things LyX can do\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX has WYSIWYM support for tables.

 dialog box which allows extensive table editing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX also supports including pictures in a number of formats (including JPEG
 and other bitmap formats, PostScript® and raw LaTeX) within documents.
 (You guessed it: 
\family sans
\bar under

\bar default
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under

\bar default
raphics
\family default
.
 Then click on the figure to choose the file to include, rotate or scale
 it, etc.) Tables and figures can have captions, and LyX will automatically
 generate lists of figures and/or tables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Version control is supported, using RCS (
\family typewriter
man rcsintro
\family default
 for more info).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX is heavily configurable.
 Everything from how the LyX window looks to how the output comes out can
 be configured in a number of ways.
 Much configuration is done through 
\family sans
\bar under
T
\bar default
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under

\bar default
references
\family default
.
 For more information on this, check out 
\family sans

\bar default
elp\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
C
\bar default
ustomization\SpecialChar \@.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX is being developed by a team of programmers on five continents.
 Therefore, LyX has better support for non-English languages (such as Dutch,
 German, French, Greek, Czech, Turkish, \SpecialChar \ldots{}
) than many word processors.
 Even some right-to-left languages like Hebrew or Arabic are supported.
 You can write documents in other languages, but you can also configure
 LyX to show its menus and error messages in other languages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The LyX menus feature keybindings.
 This means that you can do 
\family sans

 Keybindings are also configurable.

LyX can read in LaTeX documents.
 See Section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Spellchecking and thesaurus facilities are available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The text box near the bottom of the LyX window is called the minibuffer
 (after a similar feature in 
\family typewriter
emacs
\family default
).
 This gives you access to all sorts of interesting functionality, including
 functionality which could break your document.
 In other words, don't type in the minibuffer unless you know what you're
 doing.

\begin_layout Section
LyX for LaTeX Users
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand label

\end_inset

If you don't know anything about LaTeX, you don't have to read this section.
 Actually, you might want to 
\emph on
learn
\emph default
 about LaTeX, and then read this chapter.
 However, many people who begin to use LyX will be familiar with LaTeX.
 If you are such a person, you may be wondering if LyX can really do everything
 LaTeX can do.
 The short answer is that LyX can do pretty much everything LaTeX can do
 in one form or another, and it definitely simplifies most parts of writing
 a LaTeX document.
 The tool that is used to convert a LaTeX document to LyX was rewritten
 completely for LyX\InsetSpace ~
1.4.
 It should now be able to handle most LaTeX gracefully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because this is just a tutorial, we are only going to mention things that
 new LyX users will most likely be interested in.
 In the interests of keeping the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 short, we will give only minimal information here.
 The 
\emph on
Extended Features
\emph default
 manual, specifically the 
\emph on
Secrets of the LaTeX Masters
\emph default
 chapter, has a great deal of information on differences between LyX and
 LaTeX, and how to do various LaTeX tricks in LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
TeX Mode 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anything that you enter in TeX mode will be passed straight to LaTeX, and
 will be displayed in red on the screen.
 You can use TeX commands in LyX by choosing 
\family sans
\bar under
I
\bar default
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Te
\bar under
X
\bar default
\InsetSpace ~
Code
\family default
.
 This creates a text box, and everything within it is passed straight to
 LaTeX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a math formula, TeX mode is handled a bit differently.
 Enter TeX mode by typing a backslash.
 The backslash is not written out, but anything you type afterwards will
 be in red.
 You exit TeX mode by typing 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 or some other non-alphabetic character, like a number, underscore, caret,
 or parenthesis.
 Once you exit TeX mode, if LyX knows the TeX command you've typed in, it
 will convert it to WYSIWYM\SpecialChar \@.
 So if, in a formula, you type 
\family typewriter

\backslash
gamma
\family default
, then when you type 
\family sans
Space
\family default
, LyX will change the red 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gamma
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to a blue 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This will work for almost all, non-complicated math macros.
 This may be faster than using the 
\family sans
Math\InsetSpace ~
Panel
\family default
, and will be especially convenient for experienced LaTeX users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a special case, if you type a brace in TeX mode, then the beginning 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 ending braces will be inserted in red, then take you 
\emph on
out
\emph default
 of TeX mode and place the cursor between the braces.
 This makes it more convenient to type commands that LyX doesn't know which
 take an argument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX can't do absolutely everything that LaTeX can do (yet?).
 Some fancy functions are not supported at all, while some work but aren't
 WYSIWYM.
 TeX mode allows users to get the full flexibility of LaTeX, while having
 all the convenient features of LyX, like WYSIWYM math, tables, and editing.
 LyX could never support every LaTeX package.
 However, by typing 
\family typewriter

\backslash
usepackage{foo}
\family default
 in the preamble (see Section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:preamble"

\end_inset

), you can use any package you want --- although you won't have WYSIWYM
 support for that package's features.

 from the command line, possibly using fancier options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
tex2lyx
\family default
 will translate most legal LaTeX, but not everything.
 It will leave things it doesn't understand in TeX mode, so after translating
 a file with 
\family typewriter
tex2lyx

Converting LyX Documents to LaTeX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
