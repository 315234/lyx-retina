\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual is essentially Part II of the 
\emph on
User's Guide\SpecialChar \@.

\emph default
 The reason for separating this document out is simple: the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 is already quite lengthy, and it contains information on all of the basic
 features one needs to know in order to prepare most documents.
 However, the LyX Team has worked to LyX extensible through various configuratio
n files and external packages.
 That means that if you want to support the Fizzwizzle LaTeX package, you
 can create a layout file (or module) for it without having to alter LyX
 itself.
 We've already had contributions of several new features this way.
 This is the place where all of those get documented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual also documents some special features, like fax support, version
 control, and SGML support, which require additional software to work properly.
 Lastly, there's a chapter of LaTeX tools and tips, things you can use to
 spruce up your documents by directly using the powerful features of LaTeX.
 After all, LyX 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 only WYSIWYM and will only ever interface to some, not all, LaTeX features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you haven't read the 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 yet, you are definitely in the wrong manual.
 The 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 is the first place to go, since it describes the notation and format of
 all of the manuals.
 You should also be thoroughly familiar with the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 and all of the basic features of LyX before attempting to read this one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since all the topics in this manual depend heavily on LyX's interaction
 with LaTeX, this first chapter covers the inner workings of LyX and how
 to direct LyX to generate exactly the LaTeX code you want.
 It is obviously for more seasoned LyX users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
LyX and LaTeX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How LyX Uses LaTeX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter is for both TeX-nicians and the LaTeX-curious.
 In it, we'll explain how LyX and LaTeX work together to produce printable
 output.
 This is the only place in any of the manuals where we assume you know something
 about LaTeX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At one time, LyX was called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

WYSIWYM frontend to LaTeX,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but that's no longer true.
 There are frontends to LaTeX out there.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some familar ones are TeXmaker and kile, on Linux, and TeXshop, OSX.
 There are also the LaTeX modes for vi and emacs, of course.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 These are basically text editors with the ability to run LaTeX and mark
 any errors in the file you're editing.
 Although LyX 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 an editor, and it 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 run LaTeX, and it also indicates errors in the file, it also does much,
 much more.
 For one thing, you don't need to know LaTeX to use LyX effectively.
 And LyX has added its own extensions to LaTeX.
 Try the following sometime: select 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Export\SpecialChar \menuseparator
LaTeX
\end_layout

\end_inset

 from the 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 menu (or 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
View\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\end_layout

\end_inset

), then look at the preamble of the resulting 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file.
 You'll notice a variety of new macros defined specifically by LyX.
 These macros are defined automatically, according to the features you use
 in the document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several commands that automatically invoke LaTeX.
 They are:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will only invoke LaTeX if the file has changed since the last time
 LaTeX was run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When LyX runs LaTeX on the file you're editing, it performs these steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Convert the document to LaTeX and save to a file with the extension 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in place of 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Run LaTeX on the 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file (maybe several times), and run any other commands (such as 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
bibtex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
makeindex
\end_layout

\end_inset

) needed to compile the LaTeX file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If there are any errors, show the error log.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you've run LaTeX using 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
View
\bar under
\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar default
DVI
\end_layout

\end_inset

, LyX then runs a DVI viewer to display the DVI-file.
 If you've used 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
View
\bar under
\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar default
PostScript
\end_layout

\end_inset

, LyX performs further steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Run 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
dvips
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to convert the DVI file to PostScript.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Run a PostScript viewer, such as 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ghostview
\end_layout

\end_inset

, to display the PostScript file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX does similar things when viewing, or exporting, other formats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Translating LaTeX files into LyX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can import a LaTeX file into LyX by using the 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
File\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Import\SpecialChar \menuseparator
LaTeX
\end_layout

\end_inset

 command in LyX.
 This will call a program named 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
tex2lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 which will create a file 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
foo.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 from the file 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
foo.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 LyX will then open that file.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
tex2lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 can also be run from the command line, of course.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
tex2lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 will translate most legal LaTeX, but not everything.
 It will put things it doesn't understand into TeX code, so after translating
 a file with 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
tex2lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

, you can look for TeX code and hand-edit it until it looks right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't know what TeX code is, read the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

Inserting TeX Code into LyX Documents 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anything you can do in LaTeX you can do in LyX, for a very simple reason:
 You can always insert TeX code into any LyX document.
 LyX cannot, and will never be able to, display every possible LaTeX construct.
 If ever you need to insert LaTeX commands into your LyX document, you can
 use the 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
TeX Code
\end_layout

\end_inset

 box, which you can insert into your document with 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
TeX Code
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's an example of inserting LaTeX commands in a LyX document.
 The code looks like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
begin{tabular}{ll}
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\backslash
begin{minipage}{5cm}
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is an example for a minipage environment.
 You 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

can put nearly everything in it, even (non-floating) 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

figures and tables.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\backslash
end{minipage}
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to using TeX code, you can also create a separate file containing
 some complex LaTeX structure and then use 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Child
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Document
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to include your file (you should select the type 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Input
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 We recommend that you only do this if you have a 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file which you 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 works already.
 Otherwise, you'll have a big job tracking down LaTeX errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few last points to emphasize:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX 
\emph on
does not
\emph default
 check if your LaTeX code is correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Beware reinventing the wheel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On that last point, LyX does have quite a few features tucked into it, and
 more are coming.
 Be sure to check the manuals to make sure that LyX doesn't have such-and-such
 feature before you decide you have to do it by hand.
 Moreover, there are numerous LaTeX packages out there to do all sorts of
 things, from labels to envelopes to fancy multipage tables.
 Check out 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "CTAN"
target "http://www.ctan.org/"

\end_inset

 for details, and see chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cha:secrets"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you do need to do some wild and fancy things within your document, be
 sure to check out a good LaTeX book for assistance.
 There are a number of them listed in the bibliography of the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
LyX and the LaTeX Preamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
About the LaTeX Preamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you already know LaTeX, there is no need to explain here what the preamble
 is good for.
 If you don't, the following will give you some ideas—we recommend again
 that you consult a LaTeX book for further information.
 In any case, you should read the points below, because they explain what
 you can do and what you don't need to do in the LaTeX preamble of a LyX
 document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LaTeX preamble comes at the very beginning of a document, 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the text.
 It serves to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Declare the document class.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

LyX already does this for you.
 If you're a seasoned LaTeX-nician, and you have a custom document class
 you want to use, check out the 
\emph on
Customization Manual
\emph default
 for information on how to make LyX interface to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Declare the usage of packages.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

LaTeX packages provide special commands, which are only available within
 a document when the package has been declared in the preamble.
 For example, the package 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
indentfirst
\end_layout

\end_inset

 forces all paragraphs to be indented.
 There are other packages for labels, envelopes, margins, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Set counters, variables, lengths and widths.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

There are several LaTeX counters and variables which 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 be set globally from within the preamble in order to have the desired effect.
 (There are variables which you can set and reset inside the document, too.)
 Margins are a good example of something which must be set in the preamble.
 Another example is the label format for lists.
 You can actually set these just about anywhere, but it's best to do it
 just once, inside the preamble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Declare user defined commands (with 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
newcommand
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
renewcommand
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

These are abbreviations for LaTeX commands which appear very often inside
 a document.
 Although the preamble is a good place to declare such commands, they 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 be declared anywhere (before they are used for the first time, of course).
 This can be useful if there is a lot of raw LaTeX code in your document,
 which normally should not be the case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX adds its own set of definitions to the preamble of the 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file it produces.
 This makes LaTeX files generated by LyX portable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Changing the Preamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commands which LyX adds to the preamble of a LaTeX file are fixed; you
 can't change them without patching LyX itself.
 You can, however, add your own stuff to the preamble by selecting 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
LaTeX
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Preamble
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Settings
\end_layout

\end_inset

 dialog.
 LyX adds anything in the 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Preamble
\end_layout

\end_inset

 dialog to its own built-in preamble.
 Before adding your own declarations in the preamble, you should make sure
 that LyX doesn't already support what you want to do.
 (Remember what we said about reinventing the wheel?) Also, 
\emph on
make sure your preamble code is correct
\emph default
.
 LyX doesn't check it for you.
 If there is an error, you're likely to get an error like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Missing 
\backslash
begin{document}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If you see this error, check your preamble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are some examples of what you can add to a preamble, and what they
 do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example #1: Offsets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two variables under LaTeX that control page position: 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
hoffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
voffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Their names should be self-explanatory.
 These variables are useful if you think for a moment about computer labels.
 Sometimes, the size of a print medium and the area of the medium that you
 can actually print on aren't the same.
 This is where 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
hoffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
voffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 come in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default values for 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
hoffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
voffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 are both 0
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

points, i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

the page isn't shifted.
 Unfortunately, some DVI drivers always seem to shift the page.
 We have no idea why, or why the sysadmin hasn't fixed such behavior.
 If you're using LyX on a system that you don't personally maintain, and
 your sysadmin is a doofus, 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
hoffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
voffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 can save the day.
 Suppose you're left and top margins are always 0.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

inches too big.
 You can add this to the preamble:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
setlength{
\backslash
hoffset}{-0.5 in}
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
setlength{
\backslash
voffset}{-0.5 in}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and your margins should now be correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example #2: Labels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speaking of labels, suppose you wanted to print out a bunch of address labels.
 There's a rather nice package, available at your nearest CTAN archive,
 for printing sheets of labels: 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
labels.sty
\end_layout

\end_inset

Example #3: Paragraph Indentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Americans are trained to indent the first line of 
\emph on
every
\emph default
 paragraph.
 As with all of their other weird quirks, most Americans will whine and
 moan until they can have their way and indent the first line of all paragraphs.
 (Yes, we're joking.
 (We are?) 
\emph on
Yeah
\emph default
, we are.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, this behavior isn't standard typography.
 In books, you typically only indent the first line of a paragraph 
\emph on
if
\emph default
 it follows another one.
 The idea behind indenting the first line of a paragraph is to distinguish
 neighboring paragraphs from one another.
 If there is no previous paragraph—for example, if it follows a figure or
 is the first paragraph in a section—then there is no need for indentation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're a typical American (we're still joking!), though, you don't care
 about such esoteric things; you want your indentation! Add this to the
 preamble:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
usepackage{indentfirst}

\begin_layout Standard
If your TeX distribution isn't braindead, you'll have this package, and

 they should have.

\begin_layout Section
LyX and LaTeX Errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When LyX calls LaTeX, it tells LaTeX to blithely ignore any errors and keep
 going.
 It then uses the logfile from the LaTeX run to do a post-mortem.
 After analyzing the logfile,LyX displays a dialog listing the errors.
 Clicking on any one of them will take you to the position in your LyX file
 where the error occurred.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Well, usually.
 Analyzing the logfile is a tough job, and LyX doesn't always go to the
 right line.
 There are also cases where LaTeX reports the error on one line, but the
 actual error is earlier.
 This is not unlike forgetting a closing brace in a program: You'll get
 an error, but only later.
\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_layout Enumerate
All right, you didn't use any of the fine-tuning options, you played by
 the rules.
 Did you try to pull a fancy maneuver? Did you do something funky inside
 a table or an equation, like inserting a graphic into a table cell?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do you have long sections of text where LaTeX cannot find a place to break
 a line? By default, LaTeX is rather strict about how much extra inter-word
 spacing it will add in order to break a line.
 Preferably, you should rework the paragraph to avoid the problem.
 If this isn't an option, you can wrap your text in 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash

\end_inset

 to make LaTeX's line breaking more, well, sloppy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Did you go overboard with the nesting? LyX (currently) doesn't check to
 make sure you're in the limits for nesting environments.
 If you nested a bunch of environments to the 
\begin_inset Formula $17^{\mathrm{th}}$
\end_inset

 level, that's the problem.
 (The limit in LaTeX is five.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Okay, you didn't get any error messages, but your output looks awful.
 If you have a table or figure that's too wide or long for the page, you
 need to:

\begin_layout Enumerate
trim down the table so it fits.

If something else is wrong with the output, and you didn't try to pull anything

Alternative Citation Styles

Standard BibTeX uses numbers (e.

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

[12]
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) to refer to a cited work.
 However, in many scientific disciplines, other citation styles are in use.
 The most common one is the author-year style (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Knuth 1984a

).
 LyX supports two packages that provide this style, 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
natbib
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
jurabib
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Both packages have their pros and cons, which cannot be listed in detail.
 If you only want to have simple author-year (or author-numerical) style,
 or if you want to use one of the countless style files for 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
natbib
\end_layout

\end_inset

, than the established 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
natbib
\end_layout

\end_inset

 package is probably your choice.
 If you need special features like short title references, ibidem etc., you
 might consider the 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
jurabib
\end_layout

\end_inset

 package.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The handling of both packages in LyX is basically the same.
 Go to 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem

 or

 With both packages, you will get some extra features in the citation dialog
 and you can select the style of the reference (

 and scientific works is most likely a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

must have
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, BibTeX itself does not allow you to do this.
 But with the help of some LaTeX packages, BibTeX can be extended to fit
 your needs.

\end_inset

 The advantage of this package (compared to other packages like 
\family typewriter
multibib
\family default
) is that you don't need to define new citation commands.
 Instead, you need to prepare different bibliographic databases which include
 the entries for the different sections of the bibliography.
 For example: If you want to divide your bibliography into the sections
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sources
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Scientific works
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, you first need to create two bibliographic databases, e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code

Bibliography
\end_layout

\end_inset

 the option 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:MenuItem
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Sectioned bibliography
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Now you can insert multiple BibTeX bibliographies, one for each section
 of your bibliography.
 Returning to our example: Insert the BibTeX bibliography 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
sources.bib
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and a second one for the database 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
scientific.bib
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 You are free to use the same or different styles for each section.
 Additionally, you can chose if the bibliography section should contain
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all cited references
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the specified database(s) (which is the default), 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all uncited references
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or even 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all references
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This might be useful if you would like to separate your bibliography into
 three sections: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cited sources
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Uncited sources
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Scientific works
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The titles for the sections can be added as ordinary sections or subsections.
 Since 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code

 removes the bibliography title, you have manually re-add that, too (as
 a chapter* or section*, for instance).

Multipart Documents

\begin_layout Subsection
General Operation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you are working on a large file with many sections, it is often convenient
 to break up the document into several files, or perhaps you have something
 where a table may change from time to time, but the preceding text does
 not.
 In these cases, you should seriously consider using multipart documents.
 For example, scientific papers often have five major sections: the introduction
, observations, results, discussion, and conclusion.
 Each of these could be its own separate LyX file, with one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

master
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file which contains the title, authors, abstract, references, etc., plus
 the five included files.
 It is important to note that each of these files is a full LyX file which
 can be formatted and printed on its own, as well as included in a master
 file.
 Each of these files must have the same document class, however—don't attempt
 to mix book classes with article classes.
 You may also include LaTeX files; however, these files must not have their
 own preamble (i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}

everything up to and including the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dialog provides you with a table of bullet shapes.
 A column of buttons on the left of the table provides access to the six
 different panels of bullet shapes.
 The row of buttons across the top is used to select which bullet depth
 you are changing.
 A text entry under the table shows the currently selected bullet shape's
 LaTeX equivalent and this can be edited if desired.
 If you do modify the text you will also need to specify any needed packages
 in the LaTeX preamble.

The six panels are divided up by the packages they require.
 The following table shows the mappings from button name to LaTeX packages.

' to create the pipes.
 If one of the pipes already exists, LyX will assume that another LyX process
 is already running and will not start the server.
 This means that if LyX crashes, or if for some other reason, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stale
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pipe is left in existence when LyX closes, then LyX will not start the
 server.
 (This is bug 641.) You will need to delete the pipes manually and then restart
 LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To have several LyX processes with servers at the same time, you have to
 use different configurations, perhaps by using separate user directories,
 each with its own 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout
preferences
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file, for each process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are developing a client program, you might find it useful to enable
 debugging information from the LyX server.
 Do this by starting LyX as 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
lyx -dbg lyxserver
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than this, there are a few points to consider:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Both server and clients must run on UNIX or OS/2 machines.
 Communications between LyX on UNIX and clients on OS/2 or vice versa is
 not possible right now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On OS/2, only one client can connect to LyXServer at a time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On OS/2, clients must open the input pipe with 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
O_WRONLY
\end_layout

\end_inset

 mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can find a complete example client written in C in the source distribution
 as 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
development/lyxserver/server_monitor.c
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Normal communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To issue a LyX call, the client writes a line of ASCII text into the input
 pipe.
 This line has the following format:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
LYXCMD:
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
:
\emph on
function
\emph default
:
\emph on
argument
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
clientname is a name that the client can choose arbitrarily.
 Its only use is that LyX will echo it if it sends an answer—so a client
 can dispatch results from different requesters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
function is the function you want LyX to perform.
 It is the same as the commands you'd use in the minibuffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
argument is an optional argument which is meaningful only to some functions
 (for instance, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self-insert
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 LFUN will insert the argument as text at the cursor position).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The answer from LyX will arrive in the output pipe and be of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
INFO:
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
:
\emph on
function
\emph default
:
\emph on
data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
function
\emph default
 are just echoed from the command request, while 
\emph on
data
\emph default
 is more or less useful information filled according to how the command
 execution worked out.
 Some commands, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

font-state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, will return information about the internal state of LyX, while other will
 return an empty data-response.
 This means that the command execution went fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case of errors, the response from LyX will have this form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
ERROR:
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
:
\emph on
function
\emph default
:
\emph on
error message
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the 
\emph on
error message
\emph default
 should contain an explanation of why the command failed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
echo "LYXCMD:test:beginning-of-buffer:" >~/.lyxpipe.in
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
echo "LYXCMD:test:get-xy:" >~/.lyxpipe.in
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

read a <~/.lyxpipe.out
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

echo $a
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Notification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX can notify clients of events going on asynchronously.
 Currently it will only do this if the user binds a key sequence with the
 function 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

notify
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The format of the string LyX sends is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
NOTIFY:
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph on
key-sequence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\emph on
key-sequence
\emph default
 is the printed representation of the key sequence that was actually typed
 by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This mechanism can be used to extend LyX's command set and implement macros.
 Bind some key sequence to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

notify
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Then start a client that listens on the output pipe, dispatches the command
 according to the sequence, and starts a function that may use LyX calls
 and LyX requests to issue a command or a series of commands to LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The simple LyX Server Protocol
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX implements a simple protocol that can be used for session management.
 All messages are of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
LYXSRV:
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
:
\emph on
protocol message
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\emph on
protocol message
\emph default
 can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hello
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bye
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hello
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is received from a client, LyX will report back to inform the client that
 it's listening to it's messages, while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bye
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sent from LyX will inform clients that LyX is closing.

\begin_layout Standard
A manual comes together with that package, and this text is not meant to
 replace the original manual but merely a short guide how to realize the
 correct form of your paper.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please note that the publisher of the journal was changed from Springer
 to EDP Sciences starting January 1, 2001.
 That change implicated also some slight changes of the style files, namely
 the removal of the thesaurus command.
 The LyX class aa supports the newest version of these style files, V 5.01.
 If you have an older version installed, please upgrade.
 For compatibility, the old (version 4) layout has been kept as 
\family sans
article (A&A V4)
\family default
.
 Please refer to the comments in 
\family typewriter
LyXDir/layouts/aapaper.layout
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Getting started
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is recommended you start from the example template distributed with LyX.
 If you are not using a template, note the following settings:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Select 
\family sans
article (A&A)
\family default
 in the 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Settings
\family default
 dialog (OK, that one was obvious).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Don't change the option 
\family sans
Page
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

style
\family default
: Leave it set to 
\family sans
default
\family default
.
 The whole layout is done by the macros, you shouldn't change anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The header block
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First thing to enter is the header information.
 It consists of seven entries, of which some are optional.
 They are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Title
\family default
: [required] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Subtitle
\family default
: [optional] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Address
\family default
: [required]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Offprints
\family default
: [optional] if more than one author: whom to contact for offprint requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Mail
\family default
: [optional] mail address for contacts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Date
\family default
: [required].
 Suggested format is 
\family typewriter
Received: <date>; Accepted <date> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no need to issue the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
maketitle
\family default
 command, this is done automatically by LyX when the header is finished.
 Although the order of the single header entries doesn't matter it is advised
 to keep the above sequence, just to get the best optics and meets the layout
 of the real document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to place footnotes in the header block, e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

to state your present address, just use the standard footnote via the menu
 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Footnote.

\family default
 LyX will automagically use the term 
\family typewriter

\backslash
thanks{}
\family default
 in that case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to these topics, the macros use three additional LaTeX commands
 that have no counterpart in LyX:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
and
\family default
 to separate different names for more than one author and institute, respectivel
y.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
inst{<nr>}
\family default
to mark corresponding author/institute pairs.
 The institutes are numbered sequentially as they appear in the 
\family sans
Address
\family default
 field, so you have to put a marker to each author.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\backslash
email{address}
\family default
 to supply an email address for fast contact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all cases, the appropriate command has to be entered in LyX and marked
 as LaTeX code.
 See the examples.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The abstract should immediately follow the header block.
 With version 5 the abstract environment was changed to a command, and there
 is now a resctriction to only one paragraph.
 In addition, it should contain an entry with the keywords.
 This is not yet implemented for LyX, therefore you have to enter the LaTeX
 command 
\family typewriter

\backslash
keywords{}
\family default
 by hand and mark it as LaTeX code.
 Refer to the example paper.

AASTeX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
by

Mike Ressler
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AASTeX is a set of macros produced by the American Astronomical Society
 to facilitate electronic manuscript submission to the three journals they
 publish: the Astrophysical Journal (including the Letters and Supplement),
 the Astronomical Journal, and the Publications of the Astronomical Society
 of the Pacific.
 LyX has proven to be an excellent tool for generating these documents,
 especially given its equation, citation, and figure handling capabilities.
 LyX requires version 5.0 (or higher) of these macros; preferably 5.2, which
 is the version described here, or higher.
 Versions prior to 5.0 are intended for use with LaTeX2.09 and are fundamentally
 incompatible with LyX.
 The AASTeX package may be downloaded from the AASTeX Web site

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A complete user guide is contained in that package and you should familiarize
 yourself with it thoroughly before embarking on writing a paper in LyX.
 LyX will not reduce the need to figure out all the AASTeX commands, it
 will only reduce the drudgery of typing everything in.
 It is your responsibility to ensure that the final exported LaTeX document
 conforms completely to the requirements of the journal to which you are
 submitting your paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Starting a New Paper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I strongly suggest that you start with the AASTeX template file.
 Click on 
\family sans
File\SpecialChar \menuseparator
New from
\family default
 
\family sans
Template
\family default
, enter the new file name, then choose the 
\family typewriter
aastex.lyx
\family default
 template.
 This will show the most common fields found in a manuscript.
 Simply overwrite the existing text (including the brackets, 
\family typewriter
<>
\family default
) with the correct information.
 Many of the AASTeX commands and environments can be implemented directly
 in LyX, but some cannot: most noticeably 
\family typewriter

\backslash
altaffilmark
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

\backslash
altaffiltext
\family default
, which should stick out like a sore thumb if you actually just opened the
 template file.
 For commands such as these, the LaTeX code must be entered directly and
 marked as such.
 Such commands are referred to as TeX code, or Evil Red Text.
 I tried to minimize the amount of TeX code needed in an AASTeX document,
 but there is still a bit more required than any of us would like.

\begin_layout Subsection
FAQs, Tips, Tricks, and Other Ruminations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Getting LyX and AASTeX to cooperate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be a bit tricky to get LyX to recognize a new layout and document
 class.
 When all else fails, do this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Make certain that LaTeX can find AASTeX.
 Copy sample.tex (and perhaps table.tex) from the AASTeX distribution into
 a directory completely unrelated to LaTeX or AASTeX and run LaTeX on 
\family typewriter
sample.tex
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Make certain that 
\family typewriter
aastex.layout
\family default
 appears in LyX's 
\family typewriter
layouts
\family default
 folder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rerun 
\family sans
Tools\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Reconfigure
\family default
 in LyX, then restart LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Open a regular new file, not from a template.
 Does AASTeX appear in the class list in 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Settings
\family default
?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you get a warning from an existing AASTeX document about not being able
 to find the AASTeX layout or a message about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You should not mix title layouts with normal ones
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, things haven't been installed correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
LaTeX error processing a table 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX, by default, attempts to center the table caption/title.
 This seems to produce a bad interaction in AASTeX so you should click somewhere
 in the caption/title, then select 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Paragraph
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Settings
\family default
, then set the 
\family sans
Alignment
\family default
 to 
\family sans
Block
\family default
.
 This took care of it for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
References
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of things: 1) I have noticed some funny spacing in the reference
 entries in the text.
 When you enter the bibliography item data, make sure their is 
\emph on
no
\emph default
 space between the last author and the parenthesis setting off the year;
 
\emph on
e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\emph default
type 
\family typewriter
Ressler(1992)
\family default
, not 
\family typewriter
Ressler (1992)
\family default
.
 2) Entering the references at all is not obvious.
 The easiest thing is to start typing your first reference at the end of
 the document, then mark it as type 
\family sans
References
\family default
.
 That will put a small gray box in front of what you just typed.
 Click on the box to fill in the rest of the information.
 For new references, go to the end of an existing reference and press return.
 That will create a new line with its own box, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Including EPS files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though AASTeX provides its own figure commands (
\family typewriter

\backslash
plotone
\family default
, for example), I much prefer LaTeX's standard figure commands (with the
 default graphicx).
 You can insert the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
plotone
\family default
, etc.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

commands as TeX code into a Figure Float box if you desire, but I never
 have much luck getting the layout right.
 With the standard graphics, LyX will insert a 
\family typewriter

\backslash
usepackage{graphicx}
\family default
 command into the LaTeX preamble and handle the figures in the standard
 LaTeX2e way, interspersing the figures in the text.
 I believe ApJ accepts figures exactly this way now; AJ might still use
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stack everything at the end
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Things I could have done, but didn't
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pretty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 things I could have implemented, but chose not to.
 For instance, I saw no point in double-spacing the text in the LyX window,
 even though it is double-spaced in the paper manuscript.
 Also, I chose not to make separate layouts for the preprint and preprint2
 styles.
 Since I assume you will spend most of your time in the plain manuscript
 mode anyway, I decided not to chew up more disk space with this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Final Caveat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your mileage may vary.
 I've now had papers published by both ApJ and AJ that have had 98% of the
 effort done in LyX; the last 2% was the LaTeX post-processing and a few
 cleanups.
 I have had no trouble with the submission process, and I'm sure the journals
 were never aware that there might be a difference.
 So, go forth and publish!

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The AMS LaTeX layouts are set up to conform to suggested styles for mathematical
 papers to be submitted to American Mathematical Society publications.
 The layouts are not tailored to a specific journal, but easily can be.
 You should refer to the AMS documentation for specific instructions for
 each journal (usually it will entail only changing a single line in the
 TeX output).
 That documentation is available on the Web at 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.ams.org
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or by ftp at 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amslatex/
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 These layouts are appropriate, and useful, for any mathematical writing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two basic AMS LaTeX layouts: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
amsart: The standard AMS article format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
amsbook: the standard AMS book (really, monograph) format.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The layouts themselves contain only the minimum necessary to use the AMS
 classes.
 They do not, in particular, contain any of the `theorem' environments used
 for setting theorems, lemmas, and the like.
 These are contained, instead, in the 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (AMS)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 module, which is loaded by default when when you select one of the AMS
 classes.
 (It can also be used with other classes and can be removed, if you would
 rather use something else.) Less commonly used environments are in the 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (AMS-Extended)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 module, which must be loaded manually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, theorems and the like are numbered consecutively throughout
 the document, but this may be modified by loading the module 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (Order by Section)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or, if you are using 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
book (AMS)
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the module 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (Order by Chapter)
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 These will number the results as 
\begin_inset Formula $n.m$
\end_inset

, where the first number refers to the section (or chapter) and the second
 refers to the total number of results so far in that section (or chapter).
 Many environments are also available unnumbered.
 These are indicated by an asterisk at the end.
 If you happen to want 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 unnumbered results, the the module 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (Starred)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 provides that option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that these modules do not 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 to be used with the AMS classes.
 It is perfectly possible to use the 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (AMS)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 module, and the others mentioned, with other classes, such as 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code

\end_inset

, and so forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What these layouts provide
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a long list of included environments provided by these layouts.
 In AMS-LaTeX, there is, in fact, an opportunity to define an unlimited
 variety of `theorem' environments.
 However, the AMS recommends the environments that are available in LyX.

 These same environments are provided only in the starred versions by the
 
\begin_inset Flex CharStyle:Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (Starred)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 module:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
This is typically used for the statements of major results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary*
This is used for statements which follow fairly directly from previous statement
s.
 Again, these can be major results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
These are smaller results needed to prove other statements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
These are less major results which (hopefully) add to the general theory
 being discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Conjecture
These are statements provided without justification, which the author does
 not know how to prove, but which seem to be true (to the author, at least).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition*
Guess what this is for.
 The font is different for this environment than for the previous ones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example*
Used for examples illustrating proven results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
It's not really known what this is for.
 You should figure it out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Exercise*
Write a description for this one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
This environment is also a type of theorem, usually a lesser sort of observation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Claim*
Often used in the course of giving a proof of a larger result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Case
Generally, these are used to break up long arguments, using specific instances
 of some condition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Case
The numbering scheme for cases is on its own, not together with other numbered
 statements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
At the end of this environment, a QED symbol (usually a square, but it can
 vary with different styles) is placed.
 If you want to have other environments within this one—for example, Case
 environments—and have the QED symbol appear only after them, then the other
 environments need to be nested within the proof environment.
 See the section 
\emph on
Nesting Environments
\emph default
 of the 
\emph on

\emph default
 for information on nesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Algorithm*
A general procedure to be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Axiom*
This is a property or statement taken as true within the system being discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Condition*
Sometimes used to state a condition assumed within the present context of
 discussion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Note*
Similar to a Remark.

\begin_layout Notation*
Used for the explanation of, yes, notation.

\begin_layout Acknowledgement*
Acknowledgement.

\begin_layout Conclusion*
Sometimes used at the end of a long train of argument.

\begin_layout Fact
Used in a way similar to Proposition, though perhaps lower on the scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the AMS classes automatically provide the AMS LaTeX and AMS

\begin_layout Standard
Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.
 provides a standard LaTeX document class (

) for submitting articles to their various journals.
 The style file can be downloaded directly from their web site: 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://authors.elsevier.com/
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Instructions are supplied along with the class file, which details the
 requirements of the publishers.
 LyX includes package that allows for the use of this class, by a layout
 and a template file.
 Installation of the class file is the same as for any other LaTeX package;
 instructions are provided in the Elsevier documentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make use of 
\family typewriter
elsart.cls
\family default
, a file 
\family typewriter
elsart.layout
\family default
 is supplied.
 As the Elsevier class file is based mainly on the standard article class,
 most of the normal functionality is provided.
 The Elsevier class defines a number of mathematical environments, which
 are similar to the AMS environments.
 These commands are all described in the Elsevier documentation, and are
 available in LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest way to use the Elsevier style is to base documents on the included
 template file.
 It is best not to use options such as fancy headings or the geometry package,
 as elements such as these are defined by Elsevier in their style file.
 Ideally, no extra packages except those mentioned in the Elsevier documentation
 should be used.
 Essentially, Elsevier require as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clean
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a LaTeX file as possible, as their intention is to take the supplied file
 and replace the class file with one for the particular journal to which
 the paper has been submitted.
 This also means that not too much time should be spent on the formating
 of the document.
 When it comes to be published, this will change anyway.
 The rest of the usage for this layout is substantially the same as for
 the normal article class.
 For details of what Elsevier do and don't allow, refer to their documentation.

dvips
\series default
 This is automatically set each time you create a new

TeX to use the dvips driver to rotate those pages that are set as landscape
 foils.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMx

landscape
\series default
 Simply changes the page dimensions to those of a landscape page but doesn't
 do any rotation.
 Thus if you use this option you need to use an external program to rotate
 each page or feed your paper through your printer as landscape.
 Note that this option effectively reverses the roles of the 
\family sans

\begin_layout Subsection
Building a Set of Foils
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section will give a simple introduction to using the different environments
 to build a set of foils.
 If you want to see an example set of foils, take a look at the 
\family typewriter
Foils.lyx
\family default
 file you find in LyX's 
\family typewriter
examples
\family default
 folder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Give It a Title Page
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike other classes that provide 
\family sans
Title
\family default
, 
\family sans
Author
\family default
, 
\family sans
Date
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environments, 
\family sans
foils
\family default
 creates the title on a page of its own.
 If you leave out the 
\family sans
Date
\family default
 environment LaTeX will substitute the current date (every time you regenerate
 the output).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Start a New Foil
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I mentioned earlier, there are four ways of starting a new foil.
 For portrait foils you should use 
\family sans
Foilhead
\family default
 or 
\family sans
ShortFoilhead.

\family default
 The difference between these two environments is the amount of space between
 the title of the foil (the foilhead) and the body of the foil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Landscape foils are generated using the 
\family sans
Rotatefoilhead
\family default
 and 
\family sans
ShortRotatefoilhead
\family default
 environments.
 Again the only difference is the spacing between foilhead and body.
 Both of the short versions have 0.5 inches less separation between the foilhead
 and the body.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One problem with the support for landscape foils is the requirement that
 you have to use the 
\family typewriter
dvips
\family default
 driver to generate the PostScript output otherwise the foils won't be rotated.
 It is possible to get landscape foils even if you haven't got the 
\family typewriter
dvips
\family default
 driver provided you can feed your foils sideways through your printer ;-)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Theorems, Lemmas, Proofs and more
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to a small bug in LyX you can't have two of the same type of these environme
nts directly following each other.
 They must be separated by something.
 If you try, you will just be extending the previous environment as if you
 had merged the two environments together.
 So, how do you get around this problem? The simplest option is to insert
 some text between the two environments or add a 
\family sans
LaTeX
\family default
 environment between the two with just a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
%
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in it.
 This will force LyX to produce two separate environments and hence the
 correct LaTeX output.
 An example is provided in the example file included with the LyX distribution.
 Remember, this problem only occurs if you are trying to place two of the
 same type of theorem-like environments one directly after the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lists
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You get all the commonly supported list styles found in other classes as
 well as two new ones.
 I'll only describe the new ones here.
 If you want to find out more about the other list environments check out
 the 
\emph on
User's Guide.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two new list styles, 
\family sans
TickList
\family default
 and 
\family sans
CrossList
\family default
, are designed to make it easier for you to create lists of do's and don'ts
 or right and wrong by providing dedicated environments that use a tick
 or a cross as the label of the list.
 These lists are in fact dedicated variants of the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment.
 They do however require that you have the 
\family typewriter
psnfss
\family default
 packages installed.

 Similarly, the ijmpd package is for creating manuscripts to be submitted

 Both journals are published by World Scientific.
 The corresponding document classes are named 
\family typewriter

 In LyX, the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 To write an appendix, use the

\begin_layout Enumerate
The ijmpc and the ijmpd packages use the 
\family typewriter
tbl
\family default
 command to implement table captions.
 As a result, a table created by LyX is printed correctly, but its caption
 is ignored.
 However, you can use some TeX code to overpass this problem, so that captions
 are printed as expected.
 To do so, create a float table as usual, remove the caption, and replace
 it with the TeX code 
\family typewriter

\backslash
tbl{
\emph on
your table caption
\emph default
}{
\family default
 (sic); you must also the TeX code 
\family typewriter
}
\family default
 immediately after the tabular material.
 Study the example table included in the template files to see how this
 trick is implemented.
 Alternatively, If you need table captions, you should implement the whole
 table float in a 
\family typewriter
.tex
\family default
 file, then include this file to the LyX document (

The Kluwer package is a set of macros produced by Kluwer Academic Publishers
 that facilitates electronic manuscript submission to the journals they
 publish.
 Most known of them (at least in my domain of interest) are 
\emph on
Astrophysics and Space Science
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Solar Physics
\emph default
, but there are many others (see a complete list at

 The Kluwer package may be downloaded from the site

Writing a paper

The easiest way to write a paper is to start with the Kluwer template file.

New from
\family default
 
\family sans
Template
\family default

\family typewriter
kluwer.lyx

 template.
 This will give an (almost) empty document that includes the most common
 fields found in a manuscript and a short description of their use.
 As in most templates, simply overwrite the existing text (including the
 brackets, 
\family typewriter

 Each article must be included in the environment 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Unfortunately, this environment cannot be omitted, even if you write just

 Therefore, each article starts with the command

\family default
 and, obviously, ends with the command 
\family typewriter

\backslash
end{article}

 Although this can be implemented in LyX, I didn't included it, since it
 looks ugly and can confuse the novice user.
 Therefore, you need to enter them directly and mark them as LaTeX code

Koma-Script version 2.8 has introduced a new letter class

 which supersedes the now unsupported

 It has — on the LaTeX side — a completely new interface and is not compatible

 Therefore, LyX supports both, though it is recommended to use the new class.

The biggest improvement is, though, that the letter's layout is configurable

Problems

Visualizing the Koma-Script document classes in LyX, the LyX internals cause

\begin_layout Itemize
The chapter number of a

 appearing in the same line ahead of it.
 The cause for that is the LyX internal behavior for the labeltype

\begin_layout Itemize
The paragraphs in a

 This is the standard behavior, no special LaTeX commands are needed for
 that.
 But in the

Settings
\family default
 dialog the corresponding radio button indicates 
\family sans

 A 
\family sans

 document to produce the gap, which is not what is wanted in this case.

Memoir

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Subsection
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Memoir is a very powerful and constantly evolving class.
 It has been designed with regard to fictional and non-fictional literature.
 Its aim is to let the user have maximum control over the typesetting of
 his document.
 Memoir is based on the standard book class, but it can also emulate the
 article class (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peter Wilson, the developer of Memoir, is known as the author of lots of
 useful packages in the LaTeX world.
 Most of them have been merged with Memoir.
 Therefore, it is much easier to layout the table of contents, appendices,
 chapter designs and such.
 LyX, though, does not support all of these goodies natively.
 Some of them might be added to forthcoming releases

\end_layout

\end_inset

, lots will probably never, due to the limitations of LyX's framework.
 Of course you can still use all features with the help of some native LaTeX
 commands (TeX code

 In this section, we can only list those features which are natively supported
 by LyX.

 to have a look at the detailed manual of the Memoir class

, which is not only a user guide for the class, but also both a comprehensive
 description on good typesetting and a superb example for good typesetting
 itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Basic features and restrictions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Memoir supports basically all features of the standard book classes.
 There are, however, some differences, as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Font
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

sizes: Memoir has a broader range of font sizes: 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Page
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

style: The fancy page style is not supported, due to a command clash between
 Memoir and the fancyhdr package (they are both defining a command with
 the same name, which confuses LaTeX).
 Instead, Memoir comes with a bunch of own page styles (see 
\family sans
Layout\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Page
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Style
\family default
).
 If you want to use these for the chapter pages, you have to use the command
 
\family typewriter

\backslash
chapterstyle
\family default
 in the main text or in preamble (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
chapterstyle{companion}
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Sectioning: Sectionings (chapter, section, subsection etc.) are coming with
 an optional argument in the standard classes.
 With this, you can specify an alternative version of the title for the
 table of contents and the headers (for instance, if the title is too long).
 In LyX, you can do this via 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Short
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Title
\family default
 at the beginning of a chapter/section.
 Memoir features a second optional argument and thus separates the table
 of contents from the header.
 You can define three variants of a title with this: one for the main text,
 one for the table of contents, and one for the headers.
 Simply insert two optional arguments if you need this feature, the first
 one containing the short title for the Table of Contents, the second one
 containing an alternative short title for the headers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
TOC/LOT/LOF: In the standard classes (and in many other classes), the table
 of contents, the list of figures and the list of table start a new page
 automatically.
 Memoir does not follow this route.
 You have to insert a page break yourself, if you want to have one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Titlepage: For some unknown reason, Memoir uses pagination on the title
 page (in the standard classes, title pages are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

empty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

without pagina).
 If you want an empty title page, type 
\family typewriter

\backslash
aliaspagestyle{title}{empty}
\family default
 in the preamble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Article: With the class option 
\emph on
article
\emph default
 (to be inserted in 
\family sans
Layout\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Extra
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Options
\family default
), you can emulate article style.
 That is, counters (footnotes, figures, tables etc.) will not be reset on
 new chapters, chapters don't start a new page (but are—in contrary to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 article classes—still allowed), parts, though, use their own page, as in
 book.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Oldfontcommands: By default, Memoir does not allow the use of the deprecated
 font commands, which have been used in the old LaTeX version 2.09 (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
rm
\family default
, 
\family typewriter

\backslash
it
\family default
).
 It produces an error and stops LaTeX whenever such a command appears.
 The class option 
\emph on
oldfontcommands
\emph default
 reallows the commands and spits out warnings instead (which does at least
 not stop LaTeX).
 Since a lot of packages and particularly BibTeX style files are still using
 those commands, we have decided to use this option by default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Extra features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will only describe the features supported by LyX (which is not much currently
).

\begin_layout Description
Abstract: You may wonder why an abstract is an extra feature.
 Well, it is in book class.
 Usually books don't have abstracts.
 Memoir, however, has.
 You can use it wherever and how often you like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Chapterprecis: You may know this from belletristic: The contents of a chapter
 is shortly described below the title and also in the table of contents
 (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\emph on
Our hero arrives in Troia; he loses some friends; he finds others
\emph default
).
 Chapterprecis does exactly this.
 It is therefore only sensible below a chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Epigraph: An epigraph is a smart slogan or motto at the beginning of a chapter.
 The epigraph environment provides an elegant way of typesetting such a
 motto.
 The motto itself (text) and its author (source) are divided by a short
 line.
 Unfortunately, we have to fool LyX a bit here again, since the environment
 needs two arguments (text and source).
 In this case, we have to use curly brackets (in TeX mode) between the two
 arguments: 
\emph on
<smart slogan>
\emph default
 
\family typewriter
}{
\family default
 
\emph on
<author of the slogan>.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Poemtitle: Memoir has lots of possibilities to typeset poetry (up to very
 complex figurative poems).
 LyX can only support a few of them.
 One is poemtitle, which is a centered title for poems, which will also
 be added to the table of contents (verse is the standard environment for
 poems.
 Memoir has some enhanced versions of verse, but you need to use TeX code,
 because they have to be nested inside regular verse environments, which
 is not possible with LyX).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Poemtitle*: Same as poemtitle, but it adds no entry to the table of contents.

 However, v3.1 is basically obsolete, as it works with LaTeX 2.09.

Important Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a couple of important unique aspects of RevTeX 4 which might cause
 bugs that will be even more confusing in LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In RevTeX, the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
thanks
\family default
 command goes 
\emph on
outside
\emph default
 the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
author
\family default
 command.
 The LyX equivalent is that there is a separate Thanks layout.
 Do 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 write footnotes in the 
\family sans
Author
\family default

 See the RevTeX 4 documentation for more details.

 the 
\family sans

\family sans

\family sans

\family default
) layout.
 If you put the 
\family sans
Thanks
\family default
 after the 
\family sans
Address
\family default
, the LaTeX won't compile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Drawbacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main problem with this layout is that you can't use the optional arguments
 to layouts like Email and Title.
 (The problem is not unique to this layout; you can't use optional arguments
 to the Section layouts either.) This means that after you export that file
 to LaTeX (which you'll need to do eventually to send it in to APS), you'll
 need to edit the LaTeX file with a text editor to add the optional arguments
 to set, e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

the running title for the page headers.
 Lacking these layouts makes the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
altaffiliation
\family default
 (and the equivalent 
\family typewriter

\backslash
altaddress
\family default
) useless, so the corresponding layouts don't exist, and will have to be
 added by hand.

 This section documents the former.

 As I noted earlier, there are other classes, such as

 at it.
 However, there are some things which

The option

\begin_layout Standard
The first thing you'll notice when you start up a new

 document is the font size and type: it's the equivalent of the size 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 in the

 This is also what's used in the output.
 Think of this as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visual cue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to remind you that this is a slide.
 Your final slides will use a larger font; ergo, you'll have less space.
 Of course, the larger default screen font isn't WYSIWYG, only a reminder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next thing that becomes obvious is the changes to the paragraph environment
 pull-down box [at the far-left end of the toolbar].
 Most of the paragraph environments you're used to seeing are missing.
 There are also five new ones.
 That's because the 
\family sans
slides
\family default
 class itself only supports certain paragraph environments:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, you'll notice the following new environments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
These five are kind of quirky, due to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in LyX.
 You see, LyX doesn't permit you to nest any other paragraph environment
 into an empty environment.
 Now, that's fine and dandy, but it means that you wouldn't be able to start
 a slide with anything except plain text.
 To deal with this, I've performed a little 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LaTeX magic.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Quirks of the New Environments
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:slideQuirk"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All five of the new paragraph environments are somewhat quirky due to inherent
 limitiations in the current version of LyX.
 As I just mentioned, LyX forbids environments that begin with another environme
nt.
 To get around this, the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 environment isn't a paragraph environment as described in the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should consider 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
, and 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pseudo-environments.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 They look like a section heading or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
Caption
\family default
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but really begin a [and, if necessary, end the previous] paragraph environment.
 Likewise, treat 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pseudo-commands.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 These two perform some action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common feature of all five environments, 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
, 
\family sans
Note
\family default
, 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
, is a rather long-ish label.
 The text following this label — ordinarily the contents of the paragraph
 environment — is utterly irrelevant for 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
, 
\family sans
Note
\family default
, 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
.
 LyX completely ignores it.
 In fact, you can leave these five environments completely empty.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While you don't 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 to put any text after the rather long-ish label, you might want to.
 This could be a short description of the contents of the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, for example.
 In that case, enter in your descriptive comment and hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 as you normally would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If, on the other hand, you don't want to enter in any descriptive text,
 you'll hit another LyX quirk.
 LyX, like nature, abhors a vacuum, and will not let you start a new paragraph
 environment until you put something in the old one.
 So, do this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Start entering the text that will 
\emph on
follow
\emph default
 the new 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
, 
\family sans
Note
\family default
, 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 or 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Now move to the beginning of that paragraph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Next, hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, change this new, empty paragraph to a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
, 
\family sans
Note
\family default
, 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 or 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
.

 Naturally, I'll describe all of the ways the

 Filling in the contents, however, is up to you.

] tells LyX to begin a new slide [duh].
 The label for this environment/
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 in cool blue, followed by the label, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

NewSlide:
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 Any text or paragraph environments that follow this one go on the new slide.
 It's that simple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slides are probably the only time you'll need to forcibly end pages in LyX
 (this can be specified in the 
\family sans
Paragraph Layout
\family default
 dialog).
 In fact, you'll want to, once you finish entering the contents of one slide.
 If you've entered more text than can physically fit on a slide, the extra
 overflows onto a new slide.
 I don't recommend doing this, however, since the overflow slide won't have
 any page number on it.
 Furthermore, it may interfere with any 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 you've made to accompany the oversized 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 environments work the same way as the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 environment.
 They both create an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ASCII line
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 followed by a label [
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

NewOverlay:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

NewNote:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, respectively].
 The color is a stunning magenta instead of blue, and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ASCII line
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will look different, in style and in length.
 The label fonts of all three also differ from one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, if the contents of a 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 exceed the physical size of a slide or sheet of paper, the extra will overflow
 onto a new sheet.
 Again, you should avoid this.
 It defeats the whole purpose of 
\family sans
Note
\family default
s and 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Using 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 with 
\family sans
Slide
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea behind an 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 is a slide that sits atop another slide.
 Perhaps you wish to discuss a figure on the main 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 before displaying the text associated with it.
 One way to accomplish this is tape a flap of dark paper over the part of
 the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 you want to display later.
 This method fails, however, if you wish to overlap one graph with another,
 for example.
 You would then have to fumble while speaking to align the two separate,
 overlapping 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
s to align the two graphs.
 The use of an 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 environment in both cases makes life much easier.
\end_layout

\family sans

 Clearly, you want the contents of both the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 and the 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 to each fit on a single physical slide! You should probably consider an
 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

part of
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
 Indeed, the LyX 
\family sans
slides
\family default
 class provides a visual cue for this: the label at the start of an 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 is shorter than that at the start of a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
 Lastly, when you generate printable output, you'll find alignment markers
 in all four corners of both the 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 page and its parent 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
 These will assist you in lining up the two physical slides.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The major problem in overlaying two slides is aligning the contents of the
 two transparencies.
 How much space should you leave for that graph on the second slide? Worse
 still, what if you want a graph and a sentence on second slide, but there
 is text on the main transparency that goes in between them? You could try
 and insert vertical space of the right size.
 The better way is to use 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As their names imply, 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 are two command-like paragraph environments that make all subsequent text
 invisible and visible, respectively.
 Note from section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:slideQuirk"

\end_inset

 that you don't place anything 
\emph on
into
\emph default
 these two environments, however.
 When you create an 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
, it inserts a centered, sky-blue label into the page reading 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

<Invisible Text Follows>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For paragraphs following this label, the parts of the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 [or 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
; it doesn't matter which] where they would be contain instead blank space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
, the corresponding centered label is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

<Visible Text Follows>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in blazing green.
 Paragraphs following this label behave normally.
 Note that the beginning of a new 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
, or 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 automatically shuts off an 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
.
 It's therefore not necessary to use 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 at the end of a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By now, it should be obvious how to create overlay transparencies using
 the proper combination of 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText

\family default
 and 
\family sans

\begin_layout Enumerate

Before each figure or paragraph that will appear only on the 
\family sans

That's it.

\begin_layout Standard
There's one problem with the way I've designed the LyX 
\family sans
slides
\family default
 class: you can't make text in the middle of a paragraph invisible, nor
 make text in the middle of an invisible paragraph visible again.
 To accomplish this feat, you'll need to use some inlined LaTeX codes.

The purpose of a 
\family sans

\family default
 is obvious: it contains anything additional you might want to say about
 a

\family default

 It could also be used as a sheet of reminders for a particular 
\family sans

\family default

 In the case of the latter, you might want to make use of time markers.
 Currently, the LyX 
\family sans

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

native
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 support for time markers, a 
\noun on
Sli
\noun default
TeX feature.
 So, you'll have to resort to using the LaTeX codes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use time markers, you'll need to specify the extra class option 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 [see section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

].
 This option turns on timing marks, which will appear in the lower-left-hand
 corner of every 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 you generate.
 To set what appears in the time marker, you use the LaTeX commands 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
settime{}
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
addtime{}
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The arguments of both commands are time measured in seconds.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
settime{}
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 sets the time marker to a given time.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
addtime{}
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 increments the time marker by the specified amount.
 Using time markers and

 What's a person to do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Luckily, there are two LaTeX commands that allow you to select what to print
 out.
 Both must be placed into the preamble of your document.
 The command 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
onlyslides{
\backslash

\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will cause the output to contain only the 
\family sans

\family default
s and 
\family sans

\family default
s.
 Correspondingly, the command 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
onlynotes{
\backslash
notes}
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 prevents the output of anything but 
\family sans
Note
\family default
s.
 I'd advise placing both commands in the preamble and initially comment
 both out.
 You can then preview your entire presentation as you write.
 When you're done writing, you can then uncomment one of the two to select
 what you want to print.
 I like to uncomment 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\family typewriter

 and print to a

 I can then send either file to a printer, loading transparencies or plain

error boxes
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Read the warning and correct the mistake, if it is a mistake.
 If you have trouble understanding what the warning is about, you can safely
 ignore it.
 Remember that there is a hidden layer between the document on screen and
 the technical details in invoking 
\family sans

 silly.

 But it's not exactly useless as it is now: go try it on one of your existing

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A friend of mine wanted to try LyX for a group project.
 When he didn't find support for version control or file locking, he dropped
 it.
 This angered me a bit, so I thought that I should at least make support
 for RCS (with the possibility of CVS and/or SCCS as a future improvement.)
 This has now been done.
 LyX now supports some of the most basic RCS commands.
 If you need to something a bit more sophisticated you will have to do that
 manually in an xterm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you begin to use the version control features in LyX, you should
 read 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rcsintro
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (a man file, read it with 
\family typewriter
man rcsintro
\family default
).
 This file describes all the basic features of RCS.
 You should especially notice the comment about a RCS directory, and the
 notion of a master RCS file (the file ending in 
\family typewriter
,v
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later basic CVS/SVN support was added.
 You should be familiar with CVS/SVN usage before start using it under LyX.
 Most of the log messages are not currently displayed after operations -
 you can check them in terminal window if unsure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation in LyX assumes a recent version of the GNU RCS or CVS/SVN
 package—no guarantees are made for older versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For introducing your own external commands consult vc-command in the manual
 of LyX functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

 in the menu.
 And if it is under revision control, the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This command registers your document with RCS (unless you are under the
 directory managed by CVS)\SpecialChar \@.
 You are asked interactively to supply an initial
 description of the document.
 The document is now set in Read-Only mode and you have to

Check In Changes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you are finished editing a file, you check in your changes.
 When you do this, you are asked for a description of the changes.
 This is stored in the history log.
 The version number is bumped, your changes are applied to the master RCS
 file, the document is unlocked and set to Read-Only mode.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By doing this you lock the document so that only you can edit it.
 This will also make the document Read-Write only for you.
 You will usually continue editing for a while and when you are finished
 you check in your changes.
 The status line is changed to reflect that you have locked the file.

My inclination is to say that if the user cannot figure out the command

 Rubin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Preparation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to installing LyX, and having access to a Subversion repository,
 the user will need to install the Subversion client program.
 A Windows installer for the client program is available from 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "CollabNet"
target "http://www.collab.net/nonav/downloads/subversion/"

\end_inset

.
 The user may also want to install 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "TortoiseSVN"
target "http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/"

\end_inset

, which integrates Subversion operations into the context (rightclick) menu
 of Windows Explorer.
 Operations done outside LyX will typically be more convenient using the
 Explorer context menu.
 Note that TortoiseSVN is not a replacement for the client program, which
 is what LyX itself will use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bringing a document under Subversion control
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before a LyX document can be brought under version control in Subversion,
 its parent directory needs to be under version control.
 If the document is being added to a project already in the repository,
 this is accomplished by checking the project out to the directory where
 the new document will be placed.
 If the project itself is not yet under version control (for instance, if
 this document starts a new project), the directory must be imported into
 the repository.
 This is done outside LyX.
 Both import and checkout are easily accomplished from the Explorer context
 menu using TortoiseSVN, or alternatively can be done using the command
 line client at a DOS prompt.
 The procedure for importing the project using TortoiseSVN is described
 below, assuming an existing repository and a new project being started
 in 
\family typewriter
C:
\backslash
new project
\family default
.
 For information on using the Subversion client program, run 
\family typewriter
svn --help 
\family default
in a DOS shell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Locate 
\family typewriter
C:
\backslash
new project 
\family default
in Windows Explorer, right click it, and select 
\family typewriter
TortoiseSVN > Repo-browser
\family default
.
 If necessary, adjust the URL for the repository, then click OK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Right click the level of the repository under which you want to place the
 new project folder (typically the top level) and click 
\family typewriter
Create folder\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\family default
 Supply a name for the project folder and click OK.
 Add a message for the log file if desired, then click OK again.
 The new project folder should appear in the repository.
 Finally, click OK again to exit the repository browser.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Once again right click 
\family typewriter
C:

 Select the URL of the project folder
 you just created in the repository, and set the checkout directory to 
\family typewriter

\family default
 Click OK.
 You will be warned about a non-empty folder; click OK to proceed.

Literate programming is the combination of documentation and source together
 in a fashion suited for reading by human beings.
 In fact, literate programs should be enjoyable reading, even inviting!
 (Sorry Bob, I couldn't resist!) In general, literate programs combine source
 and documentation in a single file.
 Literate programming tools then parse the file to produce either readable
 documentation or compilable source.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Selecting the document class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have installed Noweb and LyX successfully, whenever you open a new
 document or try to change the document class of an existing one, you will
 find that there are three new document classes available:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Article (Noweb)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Book (Noweb)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Report (Noweb)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You must select one of them to create your literate documents from.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that literate documents are not limited to these three classes.
 New classes can be generated from other styles like letter or in combination
 with other class variations like Article (AMS).
 If you have special needs that cannot be covered by one of the existing
 classes, let the LyX developers list (lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org) know and we
 will arrange to insert a new entry, or teach you how to do it.

It is very simple, it involves the creation of a file with four lines, and
 re-running of the auto configuration.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Moreover, if you use a literate tool other than Noweb you may need to create
 a new set of document classes for it.
\end_layout

The equivalent Noweb term is

 For historical reasons, I got used to the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scrap
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 introduced by other literate tool named Nuweb, which I used for many years
 before rendering myself to Noweb.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Noweb delimits scraps like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<<My scrap>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout Standard
The problem is that whatever is written in between the << and the 
\family typewriter
@
\family default
 must be taken literally, i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

LyX should be prevented from making any special interpretation of what has
 been written.
 This is handled by a special layout named Scrap, that works like a normal
 paragraph but has a free spacing capability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The down side of the Scrap paragraph layout is that consecutive paragraphs
 of code will be spaced with one empty line in the source code and also
 in the printed documentation.
 The work around is to enter each line of code within a single Scrap, with
 a newline (ctrl-return).
 The example above will look like this:

\begin_layout Standard
As a special note, you can also use the

%def

 construct of Noweb in your scraps to add items to Noweb's identifier cross-refe

\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_layout Standard
For an example of this usage and the resulting cross-reference output, look
 at the Literate python program in 
\emph on
LIBDIR/examples/listerrors.lyx
\emph default
 which should make this all clear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Generating the documentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point you already have a new document file with a proper document
 class, and with some code and text on it.
 How do I print it? The answer is simple, you select 
\family sans
View\SpecialChar \menuseparator
DVI,
\family default
 etc.
 Just like you would do for a plain document.
 No special procedure is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To help orientate you, I will now explain what happens inside LyX:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When the 
\family sans
Update\SpecialChar \menuseparator
DVI
\family default
 menu option is chosen, a LaTeX file is generated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If the document is of any literate class the generated file will be named
 with an extension name defined by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

literate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 format (defined in the Preferences panel), otherwise the file will have
 the usual 
\family typewriter
.tex
\family default
 extension.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Note that the only difference so far is in the name of the file, no special
 processing is required by LyX.
 Given that you formatted the code using the Scrap layout that, by itself,
 takes care of the business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the document is of any literate class LyX will then use the internal
 LyX to Noweb converter, followed by the Noweb to LaTeX converter
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The converters are defined in the 
\family sans
Tools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

 panel, under the

Conversion
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\end_inset

 to generate the LaTeX file.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Otherwise it will just skip this step.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally, LaTeX is invoked and the regular post processing continues as in
 a plain document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Independence from a particular 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

literate tool
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is easily achieved by changing the commands that are run by the various
 converters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Generating the code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the build menu option is chosen or the corresponding button in the
 toolbar is pressed, a LaTeX file is generated just like step 1 above.
 Next, LyX invokes the 
\family typewriter
Noweb->Program
\family default
 converter.
 This converter needs to be defined by the user and is not installed by
 default, though the Program format is.
 This converter (like any other converter) will have two parts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The converter program itself.
 This program performs the conversion from the one format to the other (in
 this case, from the Noweb format to the Program pseudo-format).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The error log parser.
 This is a program whose sole purpose is to rewrite error messages in a
 format that LyX understands.
 This makes it possible for LyX to place error boxes in the right places
 in the file buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first part, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Converter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 setting, should be set to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
build-script $$i
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This basically means that LyX will call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (a program or script) with the name of the Noweb file (normally a file
 in the LyX temp directory).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an implementation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that you can place in a directory on your path:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
#!/bin/sh
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
#
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
notangle -Rbuild-script $1 | env NOWEB_SOURCE=$1 sh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next part of the converter setting is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Flags
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is to be set to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
parselog=listerrors
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This will run any errors that are generated by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 process through the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

listerrors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The converter code looks in 
\emph on
MYLYXDIR/scripts
\emph default
 first, then in 
\emph on
LIBDIR/scripts
\emph default
 then on the path for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

listerrors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The build will normally take place in LyX's temporary directory, so the
 files produced by the conversion will be in that directory.
 LyX will copy out what it regards as the `main' file, but the 
\family typewriter
Noweb->Program
\family default
 conversion may produce several files, and so most of these would then be
 deleted when LyX was closed.
 The present solution is to use a `copier',
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
See section 
\emph on
Copiers
\emph default
 of the 
\emph on
Customization
\emph default
 manual for information on these.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in this case, the 
\family typewriter
ext_copy.py
\family default
 script in its default mode, so that the entire contents of the temporary
 directory is copied.
 More will get copied than is needed, to be sure, but nothing will be lost.
 If, however, you know what extensions the generated files will have, this
 can be improved by using the 
\family typewriter
-e
\family default
 option to 
\family typewriter
ext_copy
\family default
.
 This option takes a comma-separated list of extensions to copy.
 So, for example, if the conversion will generate only files with the extensions
 
\family typewriter
.c
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
.h
\family default
, then the correct definition would be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
python -tt $$s/scripts/ext_copy.py -e c,h $$i $$o
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result will be that only files with these two extensions will be copied
 out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Build instructions in the document
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last piece of the integration between LyX and noweb is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 scrap.
 Generally, the instructions for building your program should be embedded
 in a scrap of its own.
 The noweb-specific 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 above uses the notangle command to look for this scrap (called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and runs its contents through 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sh
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, such a scrap would look something like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<<build-script>>=
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

#!/bin/sh
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

if [ -z "${NOWEB_SOURCE}" ]
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

then
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

  NOWEB_SOURCE=myfile.nw
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

fi
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

[...
 code to extract files ...]
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

[...
 code to compile files ...]
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Look in 
\emph on
LIBDIR/examples/listerrors.lyx
\emph default
 or in 
\emph on
LIBDIR/examples/Literate.lyx
\emph default
 which implement two versions of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 program for some illustrations of how all of these pieces go together or
 in

 Interestingly, these three files show off the language-indepence of the
 LyX literate programming support since they are written in Python, C and
 Perl respectively.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Debug extensions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a new function implemented in the LyX server, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

server-goto-file-row" function, to be used with ddd/gdb or other debugger.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When debugging code with ddd/gdb, it is possible to invoke a text editor
 at the current execution position with a single key stroke.
 The default ddd configuration for that is shift-ctrl-V.
 It happens that you can define the editor command line invocation in ddd
 by accessing the 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Preferences\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Helpers
\family default
 dialog and changing the "Edit Sources" entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I take advantage of the new created LyX server function and this ddd feature,
 and set 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Edit Sources
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
echo "LYXCMD:monitor:server-goto-file-row:@FILE@ @LINE@" >~/.lyxpipe.in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this, whenever you are using ddd and find a point in the program that
 you want to edit, you just press shift-ctrl-V (in the ddd window), and
 ddd you forward this information to LyX through the LyX server and then
 the LyX window will show the same file with the cursor at the same position
 ddd was pointing to.
 No more guessing or long scrolling to locate a point in the program back
 from debugging !
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note however that you must enable the LyX server to get this feature working
 (it is disabled by default).
 You can enable it in 
\family sans
Preferences
\family default
 (tabs 
\family sans
Inputs
\family default
, 
\family sans

Colors customization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of colors in LyX that can be customized in 
\family sans
Preferences
\family default
.
 One of the things that bothers people is the LaTeX font color.
 The default color is red, since the scraps uses LaTeX font, and there is
 a lot of scraps in literate documents, you may get tired of seeing everything
 in red.
 You can change it by going to the tabs 
\family sans
Look&Feel
\family default
, 
\family sans
Colors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next thing is the visible presence of the newline character in the screen.
 You can choose the color of this particular character and make it blend
 in the background.
 I recommend you choosing a color that is close to the background but not
 equal, that way you still can see it is there, but it is not bothering
 you anymore.

The 
\family typewriter
multicol
\family default
 package allows switching between one and multicolumn format on the same
 page.
 Footnotes are handled correctly (for the most part), but will be placed
 at the bottom of the page and not under each column.
 LaTeX's float mechanism, however, is partly disabled in the current implementat
ion.
 At the moment only page-wide floats can be used within the scope of the
 environment.

It was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested, and
 the fashionable world dismayed, by the murder of the Honourable Ronald
 Adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances.
 The public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came
 out in the police investigation, but a good deal was suppressed upon that
 occasion, since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong
 that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts.
 Only now, at the end of nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply those
 missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain.
 The crime was of interest in itself, but that interest was as nothing to
 me compared to the inconceivable sequel, which afforded me the greatest
 shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life.
 Even now, after this long interval, I find myself thrilling as I think
 of it, and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy, amazement, and increduli
ty which utterly submerged my mind.
 Let me say to that public, which has shown some interest in those glimpses
 which I have occasionally given them of the thoughts and actions of a very
 remarkable man, that they are not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge
 with them, for I should have considered it my first duty to do so, had
 I not been barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips, which was
 only withdrawn upon the third of last month.

It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had interested
 me deeply in crime, and that after his disappearance I never failed to
 read with care the various problems which came before the public.
 And I even attempted, more than once, for my own private satisfaction,
 to employ his methods in their solution, though with indifferent success.
 There was none, however, which appealed to me like this tragedy of Ronald
 Adair.
 As I read the evidence at the inquest, which led up to a verdict of willful
 murder against some person or persons unknown, I realized more clearly
 than I had ever done the loss which the community had sustained by the
 death of Sherlock Holmes.
 There were points about this strange business which would, I was sure,
 have specially appealed to him, and the efforts of the police would have
 been supplemented, or more probably anticipated, by the trained observation
 and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Europe.
 All day, as I drove upon my round, I turned over the case in my mind and
 found no explanation which appeared to me to be adequate.
 At the risk of telling a twice-told tale, I will recapitulate the facts
 as they were known to the public at the conclusion of the inquest.

The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of Maynooth,
 at that time governor of one of the Australian colonies.
 Adair's mother had returned from Australia to undergo the operation for
 cataract, and she, her son Ronald, and her daughter Hilda were living together
 at 427 Park Lane.

The youth moved in the best society–had, so far as was known, no enemies
 and no particular vices.
 He had been engaged to Miss Edith Woodley, of Carstairs, but the engagement
 had been broken off by mutual consent some months before, and there was
 no sign that it had left any very profound feeling behind it.
 For the rest {sic} the man's life moved in a narrow and conventional circle,
 for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional.
 Yet it was upon this easy-going young aristocrat that death came, in most
 strange and unexpected form, between the hours of ten and eleven-twenty
 on the night of March 30, 1894.

Ronald Adair was fond of cards–playing continually, but never for such stakes
 as would hurt him.
 He was a member of the Baldwin, the Cavendish, and the Bagatelle card clubs.
 It was shown that, after dinner on the day of his death, he had played
 a rubber of whist at the latter club.
 He had also played there in the afternoon.

\size default
 
\size footnotesize
The evidence of those who had played with him– Mr.
 Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel Moran–showed that the game was whist,
 and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards.
 Adair might have lost five pounds, but not more.
 His fortune was a considerable one, and such a loss could not in any way
 affect him.
 He had played nearly every day at one club or other, but he was a cautious
 player, and usually rose a winner.
 It came out in evidence that, in partnership with Colonel Moran, he had
 actually won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting, some
 weeks before, from Godfrey Milner and Lord Balmoral.
 So much for his recent history as it came out at the inquest.

\noindent
The default numbering for the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 paragraph environment begins with Arabic numbers and ends with uppercase
 letters.
 Suppose, however, you wanted a different type of numbering scheme.
 Here's a quickie example of how to change the numbering scheme:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
renewcommand{
\backslash
labelenumi}{
\backslash
Roman{enumi}.}
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
renewcommand{
\backslash
labelenumii}{
\backslash
Alph{enumii}.}
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
renewcommand{
\backslash
labelenumiii}{
\backslash
arabic{enumiii}.}
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
renewcommand{
\backslash
labelenumiv}{
\backslash
alph{enumiv}.)}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 which changes the numbering scheme to uppercase Roman numerals, uppercase
 letters, Arabic numbers, and lowercase letter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, the previous example also adds a little bit extra to the numbering
 scheme.
 For example, the first level label actually looks like: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For ease of reading, we'll describe what the numbering schemes look like
 using a notation something like this: <
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

A.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

1.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a.)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

>.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see in the example, there is a label command for each nesting
 level, 
\family typewriter

\backslash
labelenumi
\family default
 \SpecialChar \ldots{}
 
\family typewriter

\backslash
labelenumiv
\family default
, as well as a counter, 
\family typewriter
enumi
\family default
 \SpecialChar \ldots{}
 
\family typewriter
enumiv
\family default
.
 There are also five 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

number printing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 commands, 
\family typewriter

\backslash
arabic{}
\family default
,

\family typewriter

\backslash
Roman{}
\family default
, 
\family typewriter

\backslash
alph{}
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter

\backslash
Alph{}
\family default
, each of which take one counter as an argument.
 You can add characters before or after these, but there's no need to add
 spaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can get really fancy with these.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
renewcommand{
\backslash
labelenumi}{
\backslash
#
\backslash
Alph{enumi}
\backslash
#}
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
renewcommand{
\backslash
labelenumii}{
\backslash
Alph{enumi}.
\backslash
arabic{enumii}}
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
renewcommand{
\backslash
labelenumiii}{
\backslash
alph{enumiii}+}
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
renewcommand{
\backslash
labelenumiv}{(
\backslash
roman{enumiv})}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
produces the somewhat out of hand numbering scheme: <
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Quotes erd

here is a much easier way of doing this, of course.
 The 
\family typewriter
dropcaps
\family default
 (or the newer 
\family typewriter
dropping
\family default
) package from CTAN allows a simple way to add such letters to your documents.
 Since this package is not a standard part of teTeX, I can't demonstrate
 it within this document, but if you copy this paragraph to a new document,
 delete the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
verb
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the pluses from the TeX code at the beginning of the paragraph, and
 add 
\family typewriter

\backslash
usepackage{dropcaps}
\family default
 to your LaTeX preamble, you will get a nice Times Roman Italic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

T
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, whose height is three lines of text and which protrudes 1 em into the
 margin.
 (Make certain you have copied 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
dropcaps.sty
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into a directory where TeX can see it.) The first argument is the amount
 of indentation; in this case the negative sign moves it into the margin.
 The second argument is the height of the letter in number of lines of text.
 The third argument is the font name: virtually anything which has a tfm
 file should work (wade through the 
\family typewriter
.../texmf/fonts/tfm
\family default
 directory for possibilities).
 My personal favorite is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
yinit
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, a fancy German font specifically designed for dropped capitals.
 The fourth argument is the letter (or letters) to be dropped.
 The 
\family typewriter
dropping
\family default
 package also offers the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
bigdrop
\family default
 command, as well as a slightly simplified

There are times when the tyranny of rectangular paragraphs must be overthrown.
 In such situations, a call to the delightful plain TeX command

 is called for.
 As you can see, completely arbitrary shapes can be laid out with a suitable
 set of linelength definitions.
 While this parshape may look a bit silly and useless, one could conceive
 of situations such as finely tuned dropped capitals, word wrapping around
 non-rectangular graphics, etc.
 which will benefit from such handcrafting.

 is the number of lines of text which define the paragraph.
 If there turn out to be fewer lines, the shape is truncated; if there are

 The
