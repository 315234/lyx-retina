\begin_layout Section
The Philosophy of LyX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is LyX?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX is a document preparation system.
 It excels at letting you create complex technical and scientific articles
 with mathematics, cross-references, bibliographies, indices, etc.
 It is very good at documents of any length in which the usual processing
 abilities are required: automatic sectioning and pagination, spellchecking,
 and so forth.
 It can also be used to write a letter to your mom, though granted, there
 are probably simpler programs available for that.
 It is definitely not the best tool for creating banners, flyers, or advertiseme
nts (we'll explain why later), though with some effort all these can be
 done, too.
 Some examples of what it is used for: memos, letters, dissertations and
 theses, lecture notes, seminar notebooks, conference proceedings, software
 documentation, books, articles in refereed scientific journals, scripts
 for plays and movies, business proposals, presentations \SpecialChar \ldots{}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX is a program that provides a modern approach to writing documents with
 a computer by using a markup language paradigm, an approach that breaks
 with the obsolete tradition of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

typewriter concept
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is designed for authors who want professional output quickly with a
 minimum of effort without becoming specialists in typesetting.
 The job of typesetting is done mostly by the computer, not the author;
 with LyX, the author can concentrate on the contents of her writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of the initial challenge of using LyX comes from the change in thinking
 that you, the user, must make.
 At one time, all we had for creating documents were typewriters, so we
 all learned certain tricks to get around their limitations.
 Underlining, which is little more than overstriking with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

_
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 character, became a way to emphasize text.
 You were forced to figure out column sizes and tab stops, and set them,
 before creating a table.
 The same applied for letters and other right justified text.
 Hyphenation at the end of a line required a careful eye and a lot of foresight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, we've all been trained to worry about the little details
 of which character goes where.
 Consequently, almost all word processors have this mentality.
 They still use tab stops for adding whitespace.
 You still need to worry about exactly where on the page something will
 appear.
 Emphasizing text means changing a font, similar to changing the typewriter
 wheel.
 This is the underlying philosophy of a WYSIWYG word processor: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You Get
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, that paradigm often results in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is All You Get
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is where LyX differs from an ordinary word processor.
 You don't concern yourself with what character goes where.
 You tell LyX 
\emph on
what you're doing
\emph default
 and LyX takes care of the rest, following a set of rules called a 
\emph on
style.
\emph default

\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
To be fair, most recent versions of the most popular office suites now have
 some sort of style sheets which follow a similar markup method.
 However, our experience is that they are still rarely used in practice.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Let's look at a little example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose you are writing a report.
 To begin your report, you want a section called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Introduction\SpecialChar \@.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So, you go into whatever menu it is in your word processor that changes
 font sizes and decide on a new font size.
 Then you turn on bold face.
 Then you type, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1.\InsetSpace ~
\InsetSpace ~
Introduction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Of course, if you later decide that this section belongs someplace else
 in the document, or if you insert a new section before it, you need to
 change the numbering for this and all following sections, as well as any
 entry in the table of contents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In LyX, you go to the pull-down on the far left of the button bar and select
 
\family sans
Section
\family default
, and type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Introduction\SpecialChar \@.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes, that's all.
 If you cut and paste the section, it will automatically be renumbered ---
 everywhere.
 And if you enter references to that section correctly (by inserting cross-refer
ence tags), LyX will automatically update them all throughout the file so
 that you never, ever type a section number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let's look at the problem of consistency.
 Five days later, you reopen your report and start Section\InsetSpace ~
4.
 However, you forget that you were using 18pt bold instead of 16pt, so you
 type in the heading for Section\InsetSpace ~
4 in a different font that what you used
 for Section\InsetSpace ~
1.
 That problem doesn't even exist in LyX.
 The computer takes care of all that silly bookkeeping about which thing
 has what size font, not you.
 After all, that's what a computer is good at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's another example.
 Suppose you're making a list.
 In other word processors, a list is just a bunch of tab stops and newlines.
 You need to figure out where to put the label for each list item, what
 that label should be, how many blank lines to put between each item, and
 so on.
 Under LyX, you have only two concerns: what kind of list is this, and what
 do I want to put in it.
 That's it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the basic idea behind LyX is: specify 
\emph on
what
\emph default
 you're doing, not 
\emph on
how
\emph default
 to do it.
 Instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You Get,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the LyX model is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You 
\emph on
Mean
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

WYSIWYM.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It's a powerful idea that greatly simplifies the mechanics of writing documents.
 This is also why LyX isn't so good for creating posters and flyers---in
 this case, you 
\emph on
do
\emph default
 want to specify exactly where everything goes, because there are no functional
 units like paragraphs, sections, etc.
 This doesn't mean LyX is missing some cool function.
 It simply means that it isn't the right tool for the job --- you don't
 use a screwdriver to drive in nails.

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a list of things you won't find in LyX:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The document ruler
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tab stops
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Extra whitespace (i.e.
 hitting 
\family sans
Enter
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 two or more times)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tab stops, along with a ruler showing you the position of things on the
 page, are useless in LyX.
 The program worries about where things go on the page, not you.
 Extra whitespace is similar; LyX adds them where necessary, depending on
 context.
 Not being able to type two blank lines in a row will be annoying at first,
 but it makes more sense once you're thinking in WYSIWYM terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are some things that exist in LyX, but aren't used as you might think:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Indenting controls
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Page breaks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Line spacing (i.e.
 single spaced, double spaced, etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Whitespace, horizontal and vertical
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fonts and font sizes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Typefaces (bold, italic, underline, etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although they exist in LyX, you generally don't need them.
 LyX will take care of these things for you, depending on what you're doing.
 Different parts of the document are automatically set in a different typeface
 and font size.
 Paragraph indenting is context dependent; different types of paragraphs
 get indented differently.
 Page breaks get handled automatically, as well.
 In general, the space between lines, between words, and between paragraphs
 is variable, set by LyX.

\begin_layout Standard
There are ways to adjust all of these (only some of which require knowledge
 of LaTeX), either for a whole document or for a specific location in a
 document.

 and/or the 
\emph on

 manual for details.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, there are a few areas where we believe LyX (and LaTeX) surpasses
 many word processors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hyphenation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lists of any type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mathematics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cross-referencing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Granted, many modern word processors can handle mathematical symbols, tables,
 and hyphenation, and many have moved towards style definitions and the
 WYSIWYM concept.
 However, they've only recently been able to do so, whereas LyX is built
 upon the LaTeX document preparation system.
 LaTeX has been around for over 20 years, and 
\emph on

\begin_layout Subsection
What is LaTeX?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LaTeX is a document preparation system designed by Leslie Lamport in 1985.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\emph on
A Guide to LaTeX2e

,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by Helmut Kopka and Patrick Daly, which has an entry in the bibliography
 of the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
\SpecialChar \@.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 It was built up from a typesetting language called TeX, created by Donald
 Knuth in 1984.
 TeX takes a sequence of typesetting commands, written in a script in an
 ASCII file, and executes them.
 Many of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tricks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the printing trade were modeled by Knuth as computer algorithms and
 incorporated into TeX, thus its excellent printed appearance.
 What comes directly out of TeX is the portable document format 
\emph on
pdf
\emph default
 or the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

device independent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 format file 
\emph on
dvi
\emph default
.
 The dvi format is often used for previews and can later be converted to
 other formats like PostScript.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TeX isn't only a typesetting engine, it also allows you to define macros.
 Most people who use TeX are actually using a macro package which Knuth
 created to hide a lot of the typesetting details.
 This is where Leslie Lamport enters our story.
 He wanted a macro package that was more user- and less typesetter-oriented,
 with a set of commands that consistently typeset things like sections,
 tables or math formulas in an uniform, consistent fashion.
 This is how LaTeX was born.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, in parallel with the development and growth of LaTeX, other folks were
 creating their own custom macro packages for TeX, ones to make slides or
 articles for math journals and so on.
 Some used the raw TeX facilities to do this, others began modifying LaTeX.
 To try and unify this mess, a team of LaTeX-nicians began to work on LaTeX2e,
 the current version of LaTeX, during the late 1980's.
 This new version of LaTeX has commands which provide an easier-to-use interface
 to TeX's macro-creating commands, aid in the use of new fonts, and so on.
 In fact, LaTeX is quite an extensive language in its own right! Users around
 the world have been creating their own add-ons for LaTeX beyond the standard
 ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to extend LaTeX: classes and styles.
 A 
\emph on
class
\emph default
 is a set of LaTeX macros describing a new type of document, like a book,
 or an article.
 There are classes for slides, for physics and math journals\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 many universities
 even have a class for their thesis format! A 
\emph on
style
\emph default
 differs from a class in that it doesn't define a new type of document,
 but a different type of 
\emph on
behavior
\emph default
 that any document can use.
 For example, LyX controls page margins and line spacing using two different
 LaTeX style-files designed for these purposes.
 There are style-files for a whole slew of things: printing labels or envelopes,
 changing indentation behavior, adding new fonts, manipulating graphics,
 designing fancy page headings, customizing bibliographies, altering the
 location and appearance of footnotes, tables, and figures, customizing
 lists, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a summary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
TeX: Typesetting language with macro capability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
LaTeX: Macro package built upon TeX\SpecialChar \@.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
classes: Descriptions of a type of document, using LaTeX\SpecialChar \@.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
styles: Alters the default behavior of LaTeX in some way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
LyX: Visual, WYSIWYM word-processor that uses LaTeX to do its printing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LaTeX is the reason why LyX differs from other word processors.
 LyX is a graphical user interface (GUI) frontend for LaTeX.
 It is designed to typeset documents using LaTeX without knowing its macro
 commands.
 But although LyX can never support all commands graphically, it offers
 its usage, so that LyX is as functional as LaTeX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just like LaTeX, LyX focuses on the context of your writing --- 
\emph on
what
\emph default
 you are typing.
 The computer then handles how it should look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Navigating the Documentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make it easier to answer your questions and describe all of the features
 of LyX, the documentation has been split up into several different files.
 Each one has its own purpose, as described below.
 Before you go plowing into any of those files, however, you should read
 this chapter thoroughly first, since it contains a lot of useful information
 and commentary that can save you some time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The developing of LyX will hopefully never stop, so that some of the documentati
on may be incomplete or a bit out of date, though we try to keep up.
 Like the rest of LyX, the manuals are the work of a group of volunteers
 who have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

, families, dishes to clean, kitty litter to dispose of, et cetera.

 in addition to the rest of this document.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, please do us a favor -- if anything in these manuals confuses you,
 is unclear, or wrong, don't hesitate to let us know! You can reach the
 current document maintainers by mailing to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Format of the Manuals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some may have printed out the manuals.
 Others may be reading it within LyX.
 There are some differences between the LyX-file and the printed version.
 First, the title is simply at the top of the document, not formatted on
 a separate page as in some of the printed versions.
 Nor are any of the footnotes or the Table of Contents fully visible.
 To open a footnote, which looks like this: 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename clipart/footnoteQt4.png
	scale 75

\end_inset

, click on it with the left mouse button.
 For the Table of Contents, either click on the grey box or click on the
 
\family sans
Navigate
\family default
 menu, where the contents are displayed automatically\SpecialChar \@.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the printed manuals, all cross-references appear as the actual numbers
 for a chapter, section, subsection, and so on.
 Online, however, all cross-references appear as a light-grey box like the
 following: 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename clipart/referenceQt4.png
	scale 75

\end_inset

.
 If you click on that box with the left mouse button, a dialog box will
 appear containing a list of all the cross-references in the document.
 This introduction has only two, the first one is named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sec:Contrib
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 You can go to the referred section by right-clicking on the box or by clicking
 the button 
\family sans
Go\InsetSpace ~
to\InsetSpace ~
Label
\family default
 in the opened dialog.
 Going back to where you came from is just as easy.
 Clicking on 
\family sans
Go back
\family default
 to go back to your earlier location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we've cleared up some of the differences between the printed and
 online versions of this file, we can start looking at the format of this
 document.
 You'll occasionally notice things in different fonts:

 Note that there are two different keybinding maps in common use in the

CUA
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 style which is the default and familiar to those coming from the PC world,
 and the

grew up

 on Unix systems and use the Emacs editor.
 Unless specifically noted, the keybindings in the documentation are from
 the default CUA map.
 If you like Emacs, you should be smart enough to read the documentation
 and figure out the bindings on your own.

\begin_layout Description
Introduction This file.

\begin_layout Description
Tutorial If you are new to LyX, and have never used LaTeX before, you should
 start here.
 If you have used LaTeX before, you should still read the 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LyX for LaTeX users.

 (Skimming the rest of the document wouldn't hurt, either.)

\begin_layout Description
User's\InsetSpace ~
Guide The primary documentation.
 We'll cover 
\emph on
most

 of the basic operation and available features of LyX here.
 The main manual assumes that you've read the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Embedded\InsetSpace ~

 It also includes many tricks of the LaTeX masters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Customization A description of advanced LyX features, including how to customize
 the overall behavior of LyX\SpecialChar \@.
 This includes such things as keybindings, internati

 This file contains info on what LyX learned about your installation.
 Check it to see if you're missing something you might like to have.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These files will reference one another as necessary.
 For example, the

Contributing to the LyX Project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Contributing to LyX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX is mostly written in C++ (the LaTeX importer is written in Python).
 It is a large project, and as a result it is not free from bugs, or the
 need for improvements in the source code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reporting a bug
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While using LyX, you may find behavior which you consider a bug.
 Crashes, though rare, can happen.
 User interface problems are considered major bugs by the LyX team: especially
 helpful are indications of parts of the LyX interface you find confusing,
 or unclear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX has a bug tracking system, which you can find at 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset LatexCommand url
target "http://bugzilla.lyx.org/"

\end_inset


\family default
.
 You should check the bug tracker before reporting any bugs, in case it
 has already been reported.
 If you have a comment on an existing bug, or wish to report a new bug,
 you may either use the bug tracker, or send an e-mail to the development
 mailing list, 
\family typewriter
lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org
\family default
.
 Archives of this list are linked from the main LyX website, 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset LatexCommand url
target "http://www.lyx.org/"

\end_inset


\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A useful bug report will at a minimum include the version of LyX you are
 having the problem with.
 Accurate, detailed descriptions are preferred - the more time developers
 have to spend to pinpoint the source of a bug, the less time they have
 for other improvements.
 Mention the system and system version you are running LyX with.
 Give the versions of the libraries you have installed on your system, and,
 if relevant, the versions of external programs that LyX uses.
 If it's a compilation or configuration problem, include the file 
\family typewriter
config.log
\family default
, and mention which compiler you are using.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Contributing fixes and new features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have made changes to LyX's source that you think should become part
 of LyX, send your changes as a diff file (in unified format) to the development
 list referenced above, along with a change log, and a description of what
 your patch does.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Contributing to the Documentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX's documentation is extensive; however LyX is under constant development,
 and each new release adds new features.
 You may find some documentation needs improvement.
 This section describes what to do if you find an error, or have some suggestion
s for improving the documentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reporting Errors in the Manuals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you find a problem with the documentation, send a message to the mailing
 list 
\family typewriter
lyx-docs@lists.lyx.org
\family default
.
 The documentation team will make any necessary fixes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Joining the Documentation Team.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LyX Documentation Project, like anything else in the LyX project, can
 always use assistance! If you're interested in contributing to the Documentatio
n Project, you need to do the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Get the latest LyX source code from 
\newline

\begin_inset LatexCommand url
target "http://www.lyx.org/trac/browser/lyx-devel/trunk/lib/doc"

\end_inset

 
\newline
Inside that directory is a file called 
\family typewriter
DocStyle.lyx
\family default
.
 Read it; it's the style sheet for the documentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Next, read the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 and the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default

\newline
The point of this exercise is to give you ideas.
 The 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 is likely to be the most up-to-date of all of the documentation.
 You should be able to glean some insights into how we want the manuals
 to read and to look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Contact the team at:
\newline
 
\family typewriter
lyx-docs@lists.lyx.org
\family default

\newline
to discuss your intended changes, and get some feedback on them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The changes you wish to make may range from improving clarity of the text,
 to doing major re-structuring of the documentation.
 Any and all improvements are gladly received.
\end_layout
