There are still a couple large bugs (or features lacking) in reLyX, and new
users (i.e., everyone) will need to know them in order to know how to avoid
them. Those bugs are currently listed in the BUGS section of the reLyX man
page. This file lists only the smaller bugs. This includes bugs which appear
only rarely, and bugs which may be more common but do not affect the printed
output.

- In optional arguments, reLyX doesn't recognize a braced bracket "{]}"
as being different from a regular bracket. You'll notice this problem if
you've got a description environment item like "\item [foo {]} bar]". This
is probably simplest to fix in the LyX file after you run reLyX. If
you're very unlucky, it could mess up reLyX, in which case you'll have to
remove it from the TeX file and put it in the LyX file after you translate it.

- The underscore character '_', when used as an argument to an unknown command,
may be copied incorrectly. \foo{a_b} will be copied in TeX mode as \foo{a_{b}}.
'_' in math mode works fine.  It also works fine as the argument to known
tokens, like \cite{foo_bar}, or even in translated arguments to untranslatable
commands (see the Syntax Files section of the man page).  Also, if you have
an underscore in a file name, you have to use the LaTeX style of \input. That
is, write "\input{a_b}" instead of the old TeX style "\input a_b" (even though
the latter is legal LaTeX). If \includegraphics can't be copied for various
reasons (see the reLyX man page), underscore will break. Finally, 
\label{foo_bar} in math mode will break.

- Complicated nesting could confuse matters. Simple nesting, including nesting
lists within lists, or having multiple paragraphs in one \item, should work.

- ' { } { } ' is a legal LaTeX way to make five spaces. reLyX will translate
it as '     ', which will show up in the LyX display, but not in the LaTeX
document. Use '~~~~~' instead. Or don't use it because it's usually bad style.

- \normalfont and \textnormal are not supported and may confuse the font stacks.
You can change "\sffamily foo \normalfont" to "\sffamily foo \rmfamily" or
even to "\textsf{foo}" to get around this problem.

- font sizing commands *usually* work. reLyX may complain about "font
confusion" when several font sizing commands are given in close proximity.
Even if it complains, it may get the sizes right.

- {\cal foo} is translated as {\mathcal{foo}}. The LyX file will display
and extra set of (red) braces, but those braces won't show up in the dvi file
or printed output.

- CleanTeX adds {} around arguments if they're not there already. It breaks
on a_b_c or a_\foo{bar}. Unfortunately, examples like that are pretty hard
to parse, so all we can do is ask you to write clearer LaTeX (or contribute
your coding skills to the reLyX project!). Sorry.

- reLyX translates {\bf foo} to \textbf{foo}. However, it also does that in
math mode. Write \mathbf{foo} explicitly in the LyX file instead.

- period in \label or \ref will word-wrap. E.g. \ref{Dr. foo} will yield
a reference to "Dr." in the LyX file, with an extra "foo}" printed as
regular text

- \end in a \newcommand, for example, will really confuse reLyX. Put the
\newcommand in the preamble to avoid this problem.

Changes in translation caused by features not (yet) in LyX:


- Centering (or right or left justifying) works on full paragraphs. Therefore,
if you have the following:
    \begin{center}
    centered text
    \end{center}
    NON-centered text without a blank line before it

the reLyX'ed file will put your NON-centered text into a new paragraph. To
closely approximate what you had, just select "No Indent" from the
Layout->Paragraph popup for the new paragraph.

- LyX support for tables isn't perfect. Some complicated column descriptions
(e.g., multiple lines between columns or @{} column descriptions) will not
be displayed WYSIWYG, but will be printed out correctly. These can be
entered using the "Extra" popup in LyX's table popup. reLyX should
translate these things correctly. In addition, '|' characters in the second
argument to \multicolumn will be ignored. (For example, if you have:
    \begin{tabular}{|cc|}
    a & b \\
    \multicolumn{2}{c}
    \end{tabular}

there will be lines to the right and left in all rows of the table.)
Tables must be their own paragraphs, while LaTeX allows a table to appear
in the middle of a paragraph. \clines will only work on multicolumns. However,
most tables that aren't too complicated will be translated just fine. For very
complicated tables, use a "skip" block, so that they will be copied in TeX
mode.

- Nested \input files will only work if you set \use_tempdir false in your
lyxrc file.
