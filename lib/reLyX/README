*			reLyX -- a LaTeX to LyX translator                     *
********************************************************************************

The purpose of reLyX is to translate *well-behaved* LaTeX into LyX.

Its main goals are:
    1) Get through a well-behaved LaTeX2e file without crashing
    2) Translate a lot of that file.
    3) Localize the parts that can't be translated and copy them in TeX mode
It seems to achieve these main goals pretty well on most files.

reLyX is in its early stages, so it still has some bugs and lacking features.
There are many improvements that can and will be made to reLyX in the
near future. However, we wanted to get reLyX out there early on, to make
it easier for new LyX users who want to translate their existing LaTeX files.

reLyX uses a modified version of the Perl TeX parser Text::TeX package written
by Ilya Zakharevich (ilya@math.ohio-state.edu). The original Text::TeX is
available on CPAN.

There are lots more details in the man pages, so try 'man reLyX'
