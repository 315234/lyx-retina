From 2.9.1.1 to 2.9.2.1
- noweb documents, with -n option (Kayvan Aghaiepour Sylvan)

From 2.9 to 2.9.1.1
- translate text argument to \resizebox, \scalebox, \rotatebox
- BUG: if syntax.default said to "translate" the third of three arguments to
  a command, reLyX would actually translate the second.
- handle \r, \k
- Change a line to work in Windows

From 2.8.1.2 to 2.9
- Empty layouts (like slide and hollywood's fadein) are supported (reported
  and pseudo-coded by Alain Castera)
- \includegraphics -- graphics and graphicx forms, to the extent that LyX
  supports them
- Bug: bugfix in 2.6.1.3 meant \n in "\ERT{text\ntext}" was lost! (Now it's
  converted to a space)
- REfixed the bug where thebibliography environment created an extra paragraph
- Handle \epsfig, \psfig
- Handle \epsffile, \epsfbox
- LyX now understands sqrt[]{}! Don't need to delete optional argument anymore.
- BUG: "\layout Abstract " had extra space at end; LyX didn't recognize it!
- BUG: tables with empty cells at end and no bottom line were mistranslated
- BUG: one-column tables could be mistranslated (HACK)

From 2.8.1.1 to 2.8.1.2
- Cleaned up directory stuff. "reLyX foo/bar.tex" wouldn't work if foo/bar.tex
  \include'd another file

From 2.8 to 2.8.1.1
- -o option allows you to create temp & LyX file(s) in a given output directory
- support figure & figure* float
- BUG: \input and \include support was broken
- BUG: reLyX didn't notice if it was trying to write to a read-only directory,
  causing bad errors. Now it dies politely.
- support \index and \printindex
- \^ and \~ are apparently legal LaTeX, so support them. Also \textless,
  \textgreater, \textbar

From 2.7.2.1 to 2.8
- support \textbackslash, \listof[tables|figures|algorithms], \ensuremath
- reLyXskip environment is magical; it doesn't get put into LyX file
- support for verbatim environment and \verb command
- _ in bibliographystyle filename works
- some "kernel cleanup", including removing some hacks, and adding methods
- -h option prints usage. So does dying due to missing options, filename, etc.
- translate \sp, etc. to their LyX-supported equivalents, using new 'reLyXmt'
  block in syntax.defaults file
- translate certain arguments to untranslatable commmands (e.g., argument
  to \mbox{}) as regular LaTeX

From 2.7.1.1 to 2.7.2.1
- Translate common optional args to \documentclass
- support TeX style \input

From 2.6.1.3 to 2.7.1.1
- support \include{foo} and \input{foo} (but not TeX's "\input foo.tex")
- -p option translates latex fragments
- Whitespace is a lot closer to lyx
- Correctly (?) translate layouts of LatexType Command found in layout files
  even if the command isn't in syntax.default. E.g., \curradr, \lyxaddress

From 2.6.1.2 to 2.6.1.3
- table bug: \multicolumn could screw up where cells were placed
- table bug: \\ \hline at end of table made broken LyX tables
- Don't print leading C-Enter for strings in TeX mode (e.g. unknown tokens)
- support optional argument to \cite
- support \hfill
- Bug: known but untranslatable tokens may need braces after them. Translate
    {\oe} or \oe{} as TeX mode \oe{}.

From 2.6 to 2.6.1.2
- Bug: \@ wasn't being handled correctly.
- BUG! An 's' coming right after a comment would be deleted!
- correct support for List (won't work for things nested in List,
    but that's OK because List is buggy anyway!) and (koma) Labeling layouts
- support for \bibliography and \bibliographystyle commands (slightly kludged)
- Buglet: needed to add a space after args in List, Description
- Better handling of spaces for tokens and regular text
- "Welcome message" with revision date
- \LaTeXe -> "LaTeX2e"; support \underbar, \noun

From 2.5.2.3 to 2.6
- text after \end{center|right|left} automatically starts new paragraph
- \bibitem and thebibliography (i.e., non-BibTeX bibliographies) support
- Partial fix to '_' bug. Non-math mode _ will translate correctly as long as
     it's not in an argument of an unknown command
- Streamlined (non-debug) output to ~ 10 short lines
- Allow comments in optional arguments to \documentclass
- Handle @{} descriptions in tables
- Added 'slide' as a regular environment in syntax.default
- syntax file stuff broke \multicolumn & \cline. HACKED them back in.
     (had to pretend in syntax file that they don't take arguments!)
- Fixed bug: *'s in regular environments are now recognized
- Buglet: font size changes in footnote caused crash
- Buglet: print \n after align commands

From 2.5.2.2 to 2.5.2.3
- Read ~/.lyx/reLyX/syntax.default (if it exists) instead of system-wide file
- Always put untranslatable text in TeX mode (never use LaTeX layout)
- LaTeX command \newline is synonomous with \\, so support it

From 2.5.1.1 to 2.5.2.2
- Look in ~/.lyx/layouts OR $lyxdir/layouts for layout files
- -s option allows user to read syntax files in addition to the default one
- "regular environments" section in syntax file (partially obsoletes -r option)
- Slight change to \latex block vs. LaTeX paragraph printing decision

From 2.5 to 2.5.1.1
- Fixed bug that made syntax.default useless in translation pass (thanks Jmarc!)
- Fix to printing things in TeX mode (improvements & removing a couple buglets)
- \thanks and \noindent supported

From 2.4 to 2.5
- Bug: \underline broke reLyX
- Try to read "foo.tex" if input file "foo" doesn't exist
- Read in a default LaTeX syntax file saying how many (required/optional)
     arguments each LaTeX command takes
- Ignore optional arguments to commands for which LyX can't handle them
     (e.g., \sqrt, \\)
- More intelligently add braces to (math) command args that are missing them
     (e.g., x^\sqrt2 now works)

From 2.3.1.1 to 2.4
- Table support! (i.e., tabular environment, \hline, \cline, \multicolumn)
- table environment (including \caption and a tabular environment, e.g.)
- (mostly) removed extra spaces (which display in LyX, but not in dvi)
- Added support for accents, including all accents in table 3.1 of Lamport,
   plus \l \L ?` and !` (last two in LaTeX mode since LyX doesn't support 'em)
- Added support for center, flushright, and flushleft environments
- Add {} to end of unknown token if necessary
- Fixed buglet: unknown token at end of paragraph didn't start new paragraph

From 2.3 to 2.3.1.1
- Don't bother translating '\ ', since ~ isn't equivalent
- Description \item commands now handled correctly (except "{]}")
- Added -c option to override the LyX file's textclass
- Fixed bug which didn't allow unknown environment nested within itself
- Ignore anything after the \end{document} command
- Fixed bug where floats (like footnote) didn't print enough \n's (which could
     lead to LyX ignoring text following the footnote up to the next \n!)

From 2.2.3.1 to 2.3
- Remove LyX-generated preamble matter (JAMatos)
- read LyX layout files from LIBDIR/layouts/ (-t option no longer necessary)

From 2.2.1.3 to 2.2.3.1
- Added -r and -t options
- deal with perl5.002 bug and fixed font commands at beginning of paragraph bug

From 2.2.1.1 to 2.2.1.3

- Add braces to \frac, plus better brace-adding for ^ and _ (still not perfect)
- Wrote a man page

From 2.2 to 2.2.1.1:
- Got rid of *many* 'uninitialized value' errors due to $ or eof
- Added abstract environment
- Fixed support for {\em foo \em bar} + partial fix for {\cal A} in math mode
- Fixed bug: math mode at beginning of a paragraph was mistranslated
- Translate '\ ' as a protected space. This is probably wrong.
- Major rewrite of CleanTeX. Only changes test.relyx2 + adds space to test.lyx
     but in the future it will allow better verbatim copying

From 2.1.1.1 to 2.2:
- Major code rewrite/reorganization: should not change functionality (Karger)
- CleanTeX is now a *subroutine*, not a separate executable (Karger)
- Added -f option to clobber existing .lyx file (Karger)

From 2.1 to 2.1.1.1
- Many little bug fixes (Karger)
