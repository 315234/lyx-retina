TODO file for reLyX

SHORT TERM:
- Bug fixes
- translate common options from preamble (some \usepackage commands)
- copy all unknown environments exactly, not just reLyXskip and verbatim
- \url, especially \url||

MEDIUM TERM:
- support more stuff from preamble, like \newtheorem
- full table support (i.e., longtable and sideways environment in tables)
- minipages
- list environments (like minipage) in syntax.default, along with the
  number of arguments they take.
- better understanding of when we're in math mode. Will (finally!) fix the
  underscore bugs, allow macro translation and perhaps environment translation,
  as well as translating \bf in math mode correctly.

LONGER TERM:
- graphicx? (in LyX 1.1 and later)
- other LaTeX packages
- "sloppy" and "fussy" translations. User chooses either to translate as much
  as possible, which may cause incorrect translations, or to guarantee that
  (dvi) output will be exactly the same as the TeX file, which may leave
  more untranslated TeX (ERT).
- macro expansion using "tme, a TeX macro expander" by Jonathan Thornburg
- better handling of spaces and comments (involves fixing the parser)
