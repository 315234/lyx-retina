# copy it alongside the .tex file (in general in the temporary
# directory). This means that an exported LaTeX file will not work,
# but this is a problem of installation of R on the user's machine.
# The advantage compared to the use of stylepath, is that the exported
# .tex file will be portable to another machine. (JMarc)
