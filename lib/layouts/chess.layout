# Remaining minor problem:
#
# Sometimes there is too much space under a \showboard, especially
# if you use some of the ornamentation commands (\printknightmove,
# \highlight or \printarrow). For now, a workaround for the problem
# is to insert (using ERT) a \vspace* command (for example,
# \vspace*{-0.5in})
