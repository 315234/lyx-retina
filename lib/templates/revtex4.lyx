introduction
\layout Standard

Any of the style options, like 
\family typewriter 
prl
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
preprint
\family default 
 should go in the 
\family sans 
Extra\SpecialChar ~
Options
\family default 
 field in the 
\family sans 
Document\SpecialChar ~
Layout
\family default 
 popup (accessed from the 
\family sans 
Layout
\family default 
 menu).
 See the REVTeX 4 manual for style options, special macros, and the like.
\layout Section

methods
\layout Standard

Special REVTeX macros must be typed in TeX mode, so typing 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
openone
\family default 
 in TeX mode yields 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
openone{}
\end_inset 

.
 REVTeX macros can also be used freely in the math editor, so you can type
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\overstar{a}}>b$
\end_inset 

, for example, which uses the REVTeX 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
overstar
\family default 
 command.
\layout Standard

You can do a bibliography by hand, as shown below, but it may be easier
 to erase that and use BibTeX---in fact, APS encourages authors to use BibTeX.
 If you do use BibTeX, use the REVTeX bibliography style file, 
\family typewriter 
revtex.bst
\family default 
 (i.e., just put 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

revtex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

style
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 box in the 
\family sans 
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Lists\SpecialChar ~
&\SpecialChar ~
TOC\SpecialChar \menuseparator
BibTeX\SpecialChar ~
Reference
\family default 
 popup).
 With either method, you can cite references with the LyX citation commands
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{mycitation}

\end_inset 

.
