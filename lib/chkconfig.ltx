% This is chkconfig.ltx, a script which tries to autodetect and
%    document your LaTeX configuration. 
% Author: Jean-Marc Lasgouttes (Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr)
% with minimal changes by Asger Alstrup (alstrup@diku.dk).
%
% This script should only be run from the configure script to update
% the files textclass.lst and doc/LyXConfig.lyx
%
% This script is in fact a complete rewrite of the original chkconfig
% script. Expect bugs.

%%% If you want to add new packages/documentclasses to be recognized,
%%% read the explanation that follow and jump to the section 'Actual
%%% inspection code' below. You do not need to understand the ugly
%%% LaTeX code below to help improving chkconfig.ltx :-)
%%%
%%% If you want to add the new package <name>, all you need most of
%%% the times is a two-steps work: 
%%% 1- Add the command \TestPackage{<name>}. The syntax is:
%%%    \TestPackage[<file>]{<name>}, which  tests whether <name>.sty
%%%    (or <file>, if this optional parameter is provided) exists. 
%%% 2- Add a description for <name> in doc/LyXConfig.lyx.in,
%%%    containing in particular a line like
%%%         Found   @chk_<name>@
%%%    This line will be replaced at configure time by the proper text.
%%%
%%% For document classes, things are even simpler, since you do not
%%% need to edit this file. Just put your layout file in some place
%%% where LyX can find it and add if you wish a description in
%%% LyXConfig.lyx.in, as described above.

%%% Some useful macros.
%   Several commands are defined to test for packages:
%    \AddLayout{<layout>} adds an entry for <layout> in textclass.lst
%    \AddVariable{<name>}{<value>} creates a new variable chk_<name>,
%      and gives it the value <value>.
%    \TestDocClass[<file>]{<name>} tests whether <name>.cls (or <file>,
%      if it is provided) exists and creates a new entry with
%      \AddLayout if this is the case. Note that you will probably not
%      need to use this directly, since the configure script generates
%      the needed macro calls automatically.
%    \TestPackage[<file>]{<name>} tests whether <name>.sty (or <file>,
%      if it is provided) exists. 
%   Both commands call \AddVariable to give value 'yes' or 'no' to
%   the variable chk_<name>.
