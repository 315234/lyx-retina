@bLatex Styles:
	shows the installed TeX Style files, which are
	available in LyX by default, like "babel" or through

@i	\usepackage{<the stylefile>}

	in LaTeX-preamble (Layout->preamble)

@bBibTeX Styles:
	shows the installed stylefiles for BibTeX.
	They can be load through
@i	insert->Lists&Toc->BibTeX Reference->Style

@bRescan:
	Runs the script TexFiles.sh to build new file lists.

@bShow Path:
	toggles the view of the file lists

@bView:
	shows the contents of the marked file. Only
	possible when the files are shown with path.

@bRun TeXhash:
	runs the script texhash which builds the a new LaTeX tree.
	Needed if you install a new TeX class or style! It runs here
	only with user-rights! Therefore you need the write-permissions
