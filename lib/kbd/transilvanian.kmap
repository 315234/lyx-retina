# Key definition file for Transilvanian keyboard
#
#   Well, I live in a multicultural environment and it is
# very frequent to use hungarian and romanian letters in the
# same document.
#   Also, I prefer deadkeys to keyboard arrangements. Here only
# "'", ";" and "q" are used as deadkeys, their initial values can be
# obtained repeating them
