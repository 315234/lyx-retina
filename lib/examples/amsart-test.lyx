\layout Thanks

To Emmanuel, for forcing me to fix this, and Jean-Marc, for making it possible,
 and necessary.
 Also to Mate, who suggested numerous improvements.

\layout Abstract

This is not very abstract.
 Note that the abstract must be part of the title stuff for AMS.
 LyX is aware of that since version 0.12.1.
 Good.
 
\layout Section

Introduction
\layout Standard

This file, and any amsart-* LyX file, can be converted to either of the
 numbering schemes by simply changing the document class in the 
\family sans 
\bar under

 popup.
 The styles are:
\layout Enumerate

amsart - The standard AMS-article format.
 All results and similar statements are numbered as 
\begin_inset Formula \( (n.m) \)
\end_inset 

, where the first number refers to the section, and the second refers to
 the total number of results (Theorems, Corollaries, Propositions, Definitions
 and Remarks, etc.) in that section.
 There are also many (but not all) environments available unnumbered, which
 is occasionally needed.
 Unnumbered environments indicated by an asterisk at the end.
\layout Enumerate

amsart-seq - Here, numbering for each type of statement is in its own sequence,
 with no reference to the section number.
 There are also many (but not all) environments available unnumbered, which
 is occasionally needed.
\layout Theorem

This is a numbered theorem
\layout Proof

\layout Standard

More text.
 Note that two occurrences of the same environment, like two definitions,
 need to be separated somehow.
 For the moment, the best way is to include a paragraph with a %, in the
 LaTeX environment, if you really want two definitions (or whatever) together,
 with no intervening text of another sort.

This is an unnumbered theorem

\layout Algorithm

first this, then the next
\layout Fact

Not fiction.
\layout Fact*

Bald statement of fact.
 Unnumbered environments are often used for emphasis, or in a short presentation
 that doesn't require numbered results.
 
\layout Axiom

It stands to reason.
\layout Definition

a word means exactly what I say it means.
\layout Definition*

Unnumbered.

 Without him I never would have learned LaTeX.
