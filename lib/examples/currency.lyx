\layout Title

Currency symbols and LyX
\layout Author

by Adrien Rebollo
\layout Standard

To obtain the main currency symbols with LaTeX, we need to use special packages.
 Here we give a brief description of how to display and print the euro,
 cent, yen and general currency symbols.
 The dollar and the pound need no special trick, so we won't speak about
 them.
\layout Section

The euro symbol
\layout Standard

To print the euro symbol, you need to get the eurofont package, available
 at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{/macros/latex/contrib/supported/eurofont}

\end_inset 

 in the CTAN.
 You'll need therefore to add to the LaTeX preamble of your LyX document
 the command : 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
usepackage{eurofont}
\family default 
.
 See the preamble of this document to figure out.
 Then you obtain the euro symbol by typing 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
euro{}
\family default 
 in TeX mode, like this : 
\latex latex 

\backslash 
euro{}
\latex default 
.
\layout Standard

There is another problem with the euro symbol : it is not included in the
 latin1 character encoding.
 So to have the glyph displayed on screen you should select iso8859-15 screen
 fonts.
 In the 
\family sans 
Edit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Preferences
\family default 
 popup, you enter 
\family typewriter 
iso8859-15
\family default 
 in the 
\family sans 
Screen\SpecialChar ~
fonts\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Encoding
\family default 
 field, and of course you'll have to choose fonts that are available on
 your system in this encoding.
 You also need to choose an appropriate keymap file : 
\family typewriter 
european.kmap
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
francais.kmap
\family default 
 should normally support the euro symbol at its usual place.
 Select your keymap in the 
\family sans 
Language\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Keymap
\family default 
 fields.
\layout Standard

The last step is to tell LyX that the encoding of your document is latin9.
 You do this in the 
\family sans 
Format\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Document
\family default 
 popup.
 It requires your LaTeX distribution to have the appropriate 
\family typewriter 
latin9.def
\family default 
 file for the 
\family typewriter 
inputenc
\family default 
 package.
 It is in my tetex-1.0 distribution, and I have understood that it is provided
 by the 
\family typewriter 
latex2html
\family default 
 program, which you can grab here : 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de/~latex2ht/}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

If you see an euro symbol here : ¤, and not some horrible glyph, that's
 OK.
 Now try to view the DVI file.
 If LaTeX doesn't complain and the printed version seems fine, you're done.
\layout Section

The cent symbol
\layout Standard

The cent symbol is currently not available with LaTeX natively.
 You need to have the package wasysym, which should be included in your
 distribution.
 You can get it at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{/macro/latex/contrib/supported/wasysym}

\end_inset 

 in the CTAN.
 Then you insert the command : 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
usepackage{wasysym}
\family default 
 in your LaTeX preamble.
 If your keymap allows the direct display of the cent symbol, great, if
 not you'll have to type 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
cent{}
\family default 
 in TeX mode, like this : 
\latex latex 

\backslash 
cent{}
\latex default 
.
\layout Section

The yen symbol
\layout Standard

For the yen, it is the same story as above, but with the package amssymb,
 or amsfonts, available at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{/fonts/amsfonts}

\end_inset 

 in the CTAN, and typing 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
yen{}
\family default 
, like this : 
\latex latex 

\backslash 
yen{}
\latex default 
.
\layout Section

The general currency symbol
\layout Standard

You know, it is the horrible little mix of cross and circle.
 You cannot obtain it on screen together with the euro symbol, because it
 is the latin1 character replaced by the euro in latin9.
 But you can always obtain it by including the 
\family typewriter 
wasysym
\family default 
 package in the preamble, and by typing 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
currency{}
\family default 
 in TeX mode : 
\latex latex 

\backslash 
currency{}
\latex default 
.
 
\layout Section

The vertical broken bar
\layout Standard

Of course it is not a currency symbol, but it is one that you can't obtain
 with plain LaTeX, so let's tell something about it.
 You must include the 
\family typewriter 
wasysym
\family default 
 package, and type 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
brokenvert{}
\family default 
 in TeX mode : 
\latex latex 

\backslash 
brokenvert{}
\latex default 
.
\layout Section

Conclusion
\layout Standard

Here we are, view the DVI, and complain to 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{adrien.rebollo@gmx.fr}

\end_inset 

 if you run into problems.
