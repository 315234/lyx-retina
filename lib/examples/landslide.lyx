How it was done
\layout Itemize


\family roman 
Just select with the mouse the text paragraphs you want to mark as minipages
 and then select
\emph on 
 
\family default 
\emph default 
Layout->Paragraph:ExtraOpt
\family roman 
 and press the 
\family default 
Minipage
\family roman 
 button and add a minipage width.
 
\layout Itemize


\family roman 
Then put cursor to the paragraph containing the figure and mark it also
 a minipage, but add also the 
\family default 
HFill between the Minipage paragraphs
\family roman 
 and
\emph on 
 
\family default 
\emph default 
Start a new Minipage
\family roman 
 options
\layout Itemize


\family roman 
You can also change the alignment in this
\family default 
 Extra options
\family roman 
 menu to middle for all minipage paragraphs for a better result.
\layout Itemize


\family roman 
Somehow (correct this if you know how) the figure size set by the 
\family default 
% of the page
\family roman 
 doesn't scale the picture right but still the 
\family default 
cm
\family roman 
 and 
\family default 
inches
\family roman 
 entries will work.
