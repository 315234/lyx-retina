\layout Dialogue

Right above me.
 There are rules for breaking a page.
 Scene headers remain attached to description.
 A single line of dialogue is pushed to the following page.
 A long dialogue passage would be split -- but I'll get to that later.

Hey, what happened?
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

A page break appeared in the middle of my dialogue.
 You use MORE at the bottom of the page to show that the character's dialogue
 continues onto the next page.
 Then CONT'D next to the character to show that it has roots in the previous
 page.

\layout Dialogue

What about parentheticals?
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

Start them about 0.5 inches to the left of the character name tab mark.
 In our case that would be at 3.7 inches.
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Joe}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

And what are they for?
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

For years, parentheticals were used to express emotion, the manner in which
 a character spoke her lines.
 Loudly, passionately, sadly, and so on.
 In recent years writers have often used them for brief bits of action.

How wide are parentheticals?
\layout Speaker

Not very -- about 1.5 inches.
 And they should wrap to the following line when they extend beyond that

I have to ask -- what happened to CUT TO:s between scenes.
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

Many writers still use transitions such as CUT TO: and DISSOLVE TO: between
 scenes.
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Joe}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

Those would introduce a new scene header?
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

And typically a different time and/or place.
 But many writers have dispensed with such transitions, feeling that a new
 scene header signifies a cut without the need of any additional indicator.

Okay, I didn't notice.
 But I thought only DAY and NIGHT were allowed on scene headers.
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

Production managers would certainly prefer it that way, but many writers
 use headers as a means of showing a particular time of day, especially
 SUNRISE and SUNSET.
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Joe}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

So that's allowed?
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

Essentially, any draft that hasn't been paid for.
 Any draft to be sent to agents, studio execs, production companies, development
 people.
 Those are writer's drafts.
 And they all should be FIRST DRAFTs, no matter how many versions the writer
 has actually written.

 What about page numbers?

Number each and every page, though you can start with page two.
 The numbers should appear in the upper right hand corner, about 0.5 inches
 down and 0.75 inches from the right page edge.
 Those dimensions are not set in stone, but the numbers should always be

I was just demonstrating the way many writers break description into shorter

 I've seen blocks of description covering an entire page.
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Joe}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

That makes for tough reading, doesn't it?
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

I know studio readers who just skip long description and read only dialogue.
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Joe}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

But there are pros who write scripts with extended descriptive passages.
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}
