 Greg Beal, gbeal@oscars.org.

I added a few lines at the end of script about binding.
 The original script ended with the words

 There were also references to tabs, which don't exist in LyX, so I made
 minor changes in the text.
 Apologies and kudos to Ann Garretson.

Parenoffset is the offset to the left of parentheticals from speaker names.

Speakeroffset is the offset to the right of the dialog margin, so changing
 dialogindent will automatically change the position of parentheticals and
 speaker names.

\layout General

You can put your Speaker names in labels, the insert cross references to
 the labels.
 The printed version will automatically be capitalized in Speaker even if
 the label is not capped.
 This way you can use them in dialogue also, and change all references to
 your Speaker's names just by changing the label.

\begin_inset Note

\layout General

Use the description after INT.
 or EXT.
 to keep it on the same page.
 Narrative is the same, except that it allows a pagebreak before it.
 Notice that I did not use the labels for Joe and April here because they
 are upper-cased in discriptions only the first time they are used.
 You could make extra labels, but I think it would be error-prone.

\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

Right above me.
 Rules for breaking a page.
 Scene headers, like INT., remain attached to Description.
 If a page breaks between a Speaker and a one sentence Dialogue, move it
 above the Speaker.
 A long Dialogue passage would be split -- but I'll get to that later.

What about fonts?

Hey, what happened?
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

A page break appeared in the middle of my dialogue.
 You use (MORE) at the bottom of the page to show that the speaker's dialogue
 continues onto the next page.
 Then (CONT'D) next to the speaker to show that it has roots in the previous
 page.

What about parentheticals?
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

Start them about a half-inch to the left of the speaker name.
 In our case that would be at 2.2 inches from the left margin.
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Joe}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

And what are they for?
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

For years, parentheticals were used to express emotion, the manner in which
 a speaker spoke her lines.
 Loudly, passionately, sadly, and so on.
 In recent years writers have often used them for brief bits of action.

I have to ask -- what happened to CUT TO:s between scenes.
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

\layout Dialogue

Many writers still use transitions such as CUT TO: and DISSOLVE TO: between
 scenes.
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Joe}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

Those would introduce a new scene header?
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

And typically a different time and/or place.
 But many writers have dispensed with such transitions, feeling that a new
 scene header signifies a cut without the need of any additional indicator.

\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{April}

Production managers would certainly prefer it that way, but many writers
 use headers as a means of showing a particular time of day, especially
 SUNRISE and SUNSET.
\layout Speaker


\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{Joe}

\end_inset 


\layout Dialogue

So that's allowed?

 Any draft to be sent to agents, studio execs, production companies, development

I know studio readers who just skip long description and read only dialogue.

But there are pros who write scripts with extended descriptive passages.

You need your script, two sheets of plain manila binding stock, a three

 No title or name on the binding stock.
 When you get it all assembled, you can hammer the brass brads down to make
 it good and tight.
 Now lets go eat.
