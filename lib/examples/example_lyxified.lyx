Basic Philosophy
\layout Standard

The basic philosophy of LyX is that you should worry about the content of
 what you're writing and not the form.
\layout Subsection

How LyX does it
\layout Standard

LyX uses LaTeX, a document preparation system designed by Leslie Lamport
 in 1985.
 It, in turn, was built up from a typesetting language called TeX, created
 by Donald Knuth in 1984.
 LaTeX is designed around a philosophy similar to that of LyX.
 Leslie Lamport once said (see reference 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{lamport}

\end_inset 

):
\layout Quote

The function of typographic design is to help the reader understand the
 author's ideas.
 For a document to be easy to read, its visual structure must reflect its
 logical structure.
 Quotations and computer programs, being logically distinct structural elements,
 should be distinguished visually from one another....
 Since LaTeX can't understand your prose, you must explicitly indicate the
 logical structure by typing special commands....
 As you are writing your document, you should be concerned with its logical
 structure, not its visual appearance.
\layout Subsection

Why LyX is better
\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:lyxbetter}

\end_inset 

LyX can be useful to more people than LaTeX.
 It's considerably easier to learn, because you don't need to learn LaTeX
 (which is practically a programming language).
 LyX is basically like other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

What you see is what you get
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 word processors, except that LyX is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

What you see is what you mean
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 In this way, it combines the ease of use of word processors with the power
 of LaTeX.
 This is a Good Thing.
 Also, the file format is platform independent.
 Best of all, it's FREE!

Features of LyX
\layout Standard

LyX has many features which make writing documents easier.
\begin_float footnote 
\layout Standard

After all, why else would you want to use it?
\end_float 
 I'm 
\shape italic 
very excited

 to talk about them.
 Here's a list of just a few.
\layout Itemize

LyX worries about margins, and footnote numbering for you
\layout Itemize

LyX makes it simple to write and edit mathematical formulae
\layout Standard

For a more philosophical discussion of why LyX is better than lots of other
 word processors, see Section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:lyxbetter}

\end_inset 

, which can be found on page 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \pageref{sec:lyxbetter}

Lame attempts to use other LyX stuff
\layout Standard

I wrote a program the other day.
 It looked like this.
\layout LyX-Code

5 REMARK MY AWESOME PROGRAM
\layout LyX-Code

10 PRINT 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

I'M AWESOME!

\layout Standard

After all that scientific thinking, I started feeling more artistic, so
 I wrote this haiku
\layout Verse

LyX is really great

Typesetting word processor

 It saves so much time
\layout Section

Math Stuff
\layout Standard

My favorite equation is the solution to a quadratic equation.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula \( ax^{2}+bx+c=0 \)
\end_inset 

 (eq.1), then 
\begin_inset Formula \( x=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a} \)
\end_inset 

 (eq.
 2).
\layout Standard

Another favorite equation is the basis of calculus: 
\begin_inset Formula \( f'(x)\equiv \lim _{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x} \)
\end_inset 

 (eq.
 3).
\layout Section

Notes
\layout Standard

A couple notes about LyXifiying this file:
\layout Itemize

I was able to remove the lines made with dashes.
 They were there purely to separate the title and references from the rest
 of the document.
 LyX (LaTeX) knows enough to separate these parts of the document with space.
\layout Itemize

I didn't bother putting the math equations in display mode.
 Also, I didn't use LyX' automatic equation numbering, because it's not
 described in the

Tutorial

\layout Itemize

I didn't have to type the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
