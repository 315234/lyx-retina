\emph on

\emph default 
 is too complex to be described completely in the "man" page format.

\emph on 
LyX
\emph default 
 is a modern approach of writing documents with a computer which breaks
 with the tradition of the obsolete typewriter concept.
 It is designed for people who want a professional output with a minimum
 of time effort, without becoming specialists in typesetting.
 Compared to common word processors, 
\emph on 
LyX
\emph default 
 will increase the productivity a lot, since most of the typesetting will
 be done by the computer, not the author.
 With 
\emph on 
LyX
\emph default 
 the author can concentrate on the contents of his writing, since the computer
 will take care of the look.
 Read more about this concept in the online documentation under the Help
 menu.

Currently, 
\emph on 
LyX
\emph default 
 uses the XForms library as a toolkit.
 
\emph on 
LyX
\emph default 
 should run everywhere, where XForms runs.
 This is on all major Unix platforms as well as some PC platforms, including
 Sun, SGI, HP, Compaq Tru64, IBM RS6000, Convex, Cray, i386/Linux, Alpha/Linux,
 i386/FreeBSD, i386/NetBSD, DecSystem(mips)/Ultrix, OS/2 with XFree or PMX
 and others.

: 
\layout Description

-help summarizes LyX usage
\layout Description

-sysdir directory sets system directory.
 Normally not needed.
\layout Description

-userdir directory sets user directory.
 Needed if you want to use LyX with different lyxrc settings.
\layout Description

-geometry WxH+X+Y specifies the preferred size and position of the main
 LyX window; see X(1).
\layout Description

-dbg feature[,feature...] where feature is a name or number.
 Use "lyx -dbg" to see the list of available debug features.
\layout Description

-x [--execute] command where command is a lyx command.
\layout Description

-e [--export] fmt where fmt is the export format of choice.
\layout Description

-i [--import] fmt file.xxx where fmt is the import format of choice and file.xxx
 is the file to be imported.
 
\layout Standard

Furthermore, LyX understands the following generic command line options
 from the Forms Library: 
\layout Description

-display host:display specifies the server to connect to.
\layout Description

-bw borderwidth specifies the border width to use to built-in objects.
\layout Description

-visual visualName requests a visual by name such as TrueColor etc.
 By default the Forms Library always selects the visual that has the most
 depth.
\layout Description

-depth depth requests a specific depth.
 Try "-depth best" or "-depth 8" if you get a bad match.
\layout Description

-debug level generates some info about the state of the XForms.
 where level is an integer between 1-5 and controls the amount of information
 to output.
 Depending on the options used when the Forms Library was built, a level
 more than 3 might not be available.
\layout Description

-sync runs the application in synchronous mode with debug level set to 4.
\layout Description

-private requests a private colormap for the application.
\layout Description

-shared requests a shared colormap even if the application needs more colors
 than available.
 For those colors that can't be allocated in the shared colormap, substitutions
 are made so the closest matching color is used.
\layout Description

-stdcmap requests a standard colormap.
\layout Description

-name newname specifies the application name under which resources are to
 be obtained, rather than the default executable file name.
