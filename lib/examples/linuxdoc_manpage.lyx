\emph on
LyX
\emph default
 is a modern approach of writing documents with a computer which breaks
 with the tradition of the obsolete typewriter concept.
 It is designed for people who want a professional output with a minimum
 of time effort, without becoming specialists in typesetting.
 Compared to common word processors, 
\emph on
LyX
\emph default
 will increase the productivity a lot, since most of the typesetting will
 be done by the computer, not the author.
 With 
\emph on
LyX
\emph default
 the author can concentrate on the contents of his writing, since the computer
 will take care of the look.
 Read more about this concept in the online documentation under the Help
 menu.

Currently,

 This is on all major Unix platforms as well as some PC platforms, including
 Sun, SGI, HP, Compaq Tru64, IBM RS6000, Convex, Cray, i386/Linux, Alpha/Linux,
 i386/FreeBSD, i386/NetBSD, DecSystem(mips)/Ultrix, OS/2 with XFree or PMX
 and others.

-visual visualName requests a visual by name such as TrueColor etc.
 By default the Forms Library always selects the visual that has the most
 depth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

 Try "-depth best" or "-depth 8" if you get a bad match.
\end_layout

-stdcmap requests a standard colormap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
