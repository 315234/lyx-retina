Introduction
\layout Standard

This file, using the amsbook layout, numbers all results, Theorems, Definitions,
 etc., using 
\begin_inset Formula \( (m.n.p) \)
\end_inset 

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula \( m \)
\end_inset 

 is the chapter number, the 
\begin_inset Formula \( n \)
\end_inset 

 is the section number, and, finally, the 
\begin_inset Formula \( p \)
\end_inset 

 is the result number in that section.
\layout Standard

This can be changed by modifying the layout file, removing the line

\backslash
