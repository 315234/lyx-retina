This file documents which tests are expected to fail. It can be used to quickly
tell if a regression has occurred. This is also useful when first running tests
to get an idea of whether some tests are failing because of missing
dependencies.

If the bug corresponding to a test has been fixed, please make sure that the
test returns successful before removing that bug from the list (otherwise this
might be a poorly written test or the bug might not be fully fixed, either of
which needs to be addressed).

It is possible that one person reports a failure and another reports success,
perhaps due to different platforms. This should be reported in the "Notes"
column.

Expected failures:
