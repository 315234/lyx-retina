Changes to the LyX format since version 220 (LyX 1.2.0) was released.
=====================================================================

2002-08-12  Andre' Poenitz <poenitz@gmx.de>

Added \lyxlock for locked math inset when written to .lyx file.
When "downgrading" .lyx files this should simple be deleted but it
does not hurt at all if it stays in. It does not have to be added
when "upgrading".


2002-08-02  Angus Leeming  <leeming@lyx.org>

Added a boolean "preview" flag to InsetCommandParams.
Currently it is written only by InsetInclude, because only this
class can generate a preview of its contents.

The LyX file now contains:

 \begin_inset Include \input{snapshot_t=40.tex}
+preview true

 \end_inset 

Earlier versions of LyX just swallow this extra token silently.

The 1.2.0 InsetGraphicsParams "size_type" and "lyxsize_type" have been
renamed as "size_kind" and "lyxsize_kind" respectively.

 \begin_inset Graphics FormatVersion 1
 	filename file.eps
 	display default
-	size_kind original
+	size_type original
 	width 7cm
 	rotateOrigin center
-	lyxsize_kind original
+	lyxsize_type original

 \end_inset
