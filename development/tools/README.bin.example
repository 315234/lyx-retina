README file for the binary distribution of LyX 1.1.5
======================================================

Please read the file README for general information on LyX.

To use this binary distribution of LyX, please follow these steps:

1) Unpack the distribution in the directory /usr/local (if you unpack
   it in a different place, please read the note below)

2) Configure LyX for you system by executing
     cd share/lyx ; ./configure

3) Make sure that the directory bin/ is in your path. For example, if
   you unpacked the distribution in /usr/local, your PATH environment
   variable should contain "/usr/local/bin".

4) If you want to use reLyX, the LaTeX-to-LyX translator, you will
   have to edit the first line of the script, which should read
     #!/usr/local/bin/perl
   if you have perl installed as /usr/local/bin/perl.
   Note that reLyX requires at least perl version 5.002.

That's it. Happy LyXing !


If you did not unpack the distribution in /usr/local
----------------------------------------------------

LyX can perfectly work in this situation, except for one thing: as
distributed, LyX expects to find its internationalization files in the
directory /usr/local/share/locale. If you unpacked the distribution in
directory /foo, you should set the environment variable LYX_LOCALEDIR
to point to /foo/share/locale as follows:
  LYX_LOCALEDIR=/foo/share/locale            (if you use sh or bash as shell)
or
  setenv LYX_LOCALEDIR /foo/share/locale     (for csh or tcsh)

Note that, if if you do not have any interest in having LyX display
its messages in other languages than english, you can safely skip this
step.
