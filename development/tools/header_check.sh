# Description:

# All .cpp and .h files in the current directory and subdirectories
# are checked to see which include statements could be omitted without
# causing a build error. Many of these omissions would not be desired.
# For example, currently if you don't include Undo.h in Undo.cpp, there
# is no error because Undo.h is included in Cursor.h which is included
# in Undo.cpp. But clearly we do want to include Undo.h in Undo.cpp.

# The results are stored in header_check.sh.log

set -u

LOG_FILE="$(basename $0).log"

# For only standard headers:
  PATTERN='^#include <'
# For all headers:
# PATTERN='^#include'

# Exclude common headers with regex
# (e.g. 'debug.h' will exclude 'support/debug.h')
# LyX was compiled on exotic environments and these sometimes
# require headers not needed on win/linux. So check the logs before
# deleting "redundant" standard libraries, Qt headers or includes around
# various ifdefs...
