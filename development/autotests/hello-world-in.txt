# Sample test script for regression tests
#
# Adapted from the syntax of the original testkeys.py by McCabe-Dansted.
# Run this script by providing it as single argument to run-test.sh
#
# WARNING: Syntax is poorly parsed: no extra spaces anywhere
#
# Lines starting with a '#' on the 1st column are comments
#
# Exec <cmd...>
#   Causes the execution of <cmd...> in a os.system()
#
# TestBegin <args...>
#   Starts a test case under deterministic conditions:
#   Any currently running instance of LyX is killed
#   A new LyX instance is spawned, with the command-line args <args...>
#
# TestEnd <cmd...>
#   Ends a test case, killing the LyX instance under test, and
#   executing the <cmd...> commands into an os.system(). The exit status
#   of the commands sequence determines success or failure of the test
#
# KK: <chars...>
#   Feeds the running LyX instance with the specified key characters.
#   Special sequences:
#     \A<char> ...... sends the sequence [Alt+<char>]
#     \[<dir>] ...... sends a cursor movement, <dir> = Right, Left, Up, Down
#     \[Tab] ........ sends a Tab character
#     \[Return] ..... sends a Return
#
#
# This example instructs LyX to type "Hello World", then exports it as
# LaTeX, and verifies that the typed characters are indeed present in the
# exported document.
