Automated tests based on the "MonKey Testing" keytest program.
======================================================================

WARNING!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the tests in this folder may cause abrupt kill of existing
LyX instances on your system. In order to avoid any possible data
loss, quit any running instance of LyX in which you're carrying out
real work. Also, although precautions have been taken in order to not
allow the key presses to reach non-LyX windows, this may sometimes
happen anyway. Please, close any running application that is not
strictly needed.


DEPENDENCIES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following programs are needed by the testing framework:
- xvkbd: a modified copy of xvkbd is included in this folder, and should
         be built before running the tests
- wmctrl
- pcregrep


USAGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to launch all the tests available in this folder, just run

  make

and do not interact with your computer while the tests are running.

If you wish to launch one or more specific tests, then provide them
as argument to the run-tests.sh script, e.g.:

  ./run-tests.sh <whatever>*-in.txt

For failed tests you get a folder with the logs that help you identify
the problem.


SYNTAX
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Each test-case script should be named as xxx-in.txt. The syntax of the
script is described in detail in the sample test-case script
hello-world-in.txt.


TODO
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Speed-up the execution of the tests as much as possible (i.e., get rid
of heuristic waits when present and replace them with exact check of
the condition we're waiting for).

Allow for tests with multiple LyX instances, e.g., for copy&paste
across LyX instances, or multiple applications, i.e., for testing
the interaction between LyX and other applications.
