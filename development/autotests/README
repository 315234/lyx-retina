Automated tests based on the "MonKey Testing" keytest program.

In order to launch all the tests available in this folder, just run

  ./run-tests.sh

If you wish to launch one or more specific tests, then provide them
as argument to the script, e.g.:

  ./run-tests.sh <whatever>*-in.txt

For failed tests you get a folder with the logs that help you identify
the problem.
