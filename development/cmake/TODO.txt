Defaults:
  * NLS disabled by default.
  * Eventually, cmake without option should generate a makefile that has reasonable defaults for everything
    (nls, spellcheck, build type, ...), at least when released.


Help:
  * I do not know how to have a list of variables from the command line
    (before I actually run it). cmake --help is not useful.
  * how can I see what the command line was. With autoconf I'd just
    do "make V=1", what shall I do with cmake?


Bug fixing
  * Run in place, without using LYX_DIR_20x
     copy the resources (bind/ ui/ layouts/ dicts/ thes/ ...) to the build stage (?)
     This is what I do: copy them from an autotools install into the cmake project.
        Package.cpp and config.h.cmake has to be fixed.
  * check that .tar.gz and .xz are identical to those from autotools
  * Fix libintl, LYX_EXTERNAL_LIBINTL=OFF triggers compilation in intl even when LYX_NLS is OFF


Documentation
  * Better documentation, variable naming, more automake-like
  * what does LYX_DEVEL_VERSION do?
  * What is the difference with LYX_RELEASE=OFF?
  * how do I specify whether I want debug informations (-g flag) for unix?


Features
  * I would like to see a BUILD_TYPE flag like in autotools, with automatic selection from lyx version
  * Disbale merging selectively
  * Make .dmg
  * Bundles for Mac OSX
    with support for universal binaries (don't know if it currently is a problem to build them)


Cleanup
  * stdlib-debug mode should be merged with windows debug mode, since it is the same basically
  * I do not like the weird paths where built files go. I really cannot find my way there
  * Shouldn't we use lower case names everywhere (when possible)?
    Then the cmake files doesn't look that antiquated. And seeing an uppercase variable means
    that this variable wasn't introduced by lyx and is a cmake default name.
