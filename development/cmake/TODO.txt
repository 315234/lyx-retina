Defaults:
  * NLS disabled by default.
  * Eventually, cmake without option should generate a makefile that has reasonable defaults for everything
    (nls, spellcheck, build type, ...), at least when released.


Help:
  * I do not know how to have a list of variables from the command line
    (before I actually run it). cmake --help is not useful.
  * how can I see what the command line was. With autoconf I'd just
    do "make V=1", what shall I do with cmake?


Bug fixing
  * Run in place, without using LYX_DIR_20x
     copy the resources (bind/ ui/ layouts/ dicts/ thes/ ...) to the build stage (?)
     This is what I do: copy them from an autotools install into the cmake project.
        Package.cpp and config.h.cmake has to be fixed.
  * check that .tar.gz and .xz are identical to those from autotools
  * Fix libintl, LYX_EXTERNAL_LIBINTL=OFF triggers compilation in intl even when LYX_NLS is OFF


Documentation
  * Better documentation, variable naming, more automake-like
  * what does LYX_DEVEL_VERSION do?
  * What is the difference with LYX_RELEASE=OFF?
  * how do I specify whether I want debug informations (-g flag) for unix?


Features
  * I would like to see a BUILD_TYPE flag like in autotools, with automatic selection from lyx version
  * Disbale merging selectively
  * Make .dmg
  * Bundles for Mac OSX
    with support for universal binaries (don't know if it currently is a problem to build them)
  * from the maintainer point of view these task are needed:
      - .po remerge of strings in po/ (ie "make update-po")
      - tarball creation, most notably i dont see any list of files which should go into tarball, we dont want everything to go there
        (ie "make distcheck" to check tree is prepared for release, "make dist" for actual release)
    these are nice to have and present in autotools, though not critical
      - target for regenaration of lfuns manual would be nice (ie make lfundoc)
      - target for doxygen generation (ie make doxydoc)


Cleanup
  * stdlib-debug mode should be merged with windows debug mode, since it is the same basically
  * I do not like the weird paths where built files go. I really cannot find my way there
  * Shouldn't we use lower case names everywhere (when possible)?
    Then the cmake files doesn't look that antiquated. And seeing an uppercase variable means
    that this variable wasn't introduced by lyx and is a cmake default name.
  * port 'development/cmake/doc/ReplaceValues.pl' to python
