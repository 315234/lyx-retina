Description

This is the readme of the variant "update" of the LyXWinInstaller. Please read
this file carefully to prevent troubles with the installer.
The LyXWinInstaller installs the wordprocessor "LyX" (www.lyx.org) and some
needed programs on Windows 2000/XP/XPx64/Vista.
! Win95, Win98, and WinME are NOT supported. !

---
General

The installer variant "update" is designed to update existing an LyX installation.
It therefore only actualized some registry entries and updates the file that were 
modified  since the last LyX release.
Custom user settings and third party programs like ImageMagick are not touched.

---
Prerequisites

You must have the last LyX-version installed, otherwise the update installer
quits with a varning about the wrong LyX version.
