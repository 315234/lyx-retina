********** WARNING **********

This file is out-dated!

Its description is based on the xforms frontend, which was dropped in
LyX 1.5. This file should eventually be adjusted to the qt4 frontend.

*****************************

Here is what to do to make a binary rpm using the spec file lyx.spec.
The description below apply only to the Intel platform, but only minor
changes should be needed for other platforms.

1) Install xforms-88 or later. You can find an xforms-0.88 rpm
at

ftp://moni.msci.memphis.edu/pub

2) Install LaTeX.  You can do this using rpms (you need tetex-xdvi,
tetex, tetex-latex) from your RH distribution.

3) Copy lyx.spec to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS

4) Copy lyx-1.0.0.tar.gz to /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES

5) Issue the command

	rpm -bb /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/lyx.spec

This builds the binary rpm, and puts it in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386.
Note that building lyx requires about 35M free space on your disk.

6) Now install the package:

	rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/lyx-1.0.0-1.i386.rpm

If you get dependency errors about xforms or tetex, then you need to
use the --nodeps option (because you installed xforms or tetex not in
rpm form):

        rpm -Uvh --nodeps /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/lyx-1.0.0-1.i386.rpm

You should not get any more errors.
