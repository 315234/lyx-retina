Project: LyX File format 3.0 (subset of LaTeX)
============================

Initial coordinator: Alejandro Aguilar Sierra


On the developers list has been discussed several times the advantages of a
LyX format compatible with LaTeX. Some of the advantages we would have are:

- A better grammar than that of the current format would led us to simpler
  and powerful syntax for insets (I'm thinking on math, figures, tables and
  accents).

- Almost anything can be expressed better with a powerful grammar.

- There are many anything->LaTeX and LaTeX->anything converters around.
  The exchange of documents would be better.

- We could have better control on the preamble of a document (options,
  packages included, macros). Only include those that are needed
  for the document.

- We could save disk space using only one format.



The following are not goals of this project:

- The parser doesn't have to be able to read every latex file (for instance
  LaTeX2.09). Still would be necessary filters to import latex files
  generated elsewhere.

- With a more readable format some LaTeX experts couldn't resist the
  temptation to edit manually the files. This wouldn't be recommended, for
  the same reason as above. Any special thing can (should) be written using
  TeX mode under LyX.



Q. Why LaTeX and not linux-sgml?

A. Well, say some good reasons in favor of linux-sgml. Does it can
   express complex mathematics expressions, nested layouts, etc. in
   a better way?
