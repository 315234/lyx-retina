			   Building LyX/Mac-1.4.0

		  Ronald Florence <ron@18james.com>

   LyX/Mac is built from the LyX source, the GPL-licensed Trolltech
   Qt/Mac library, and a custom application bundle. 

   You will need the MacOSX development tools.  The procedure
   described here builds LyX linked with a static Qt library.  If you
   are using the tcsh shell, change the "export VAR=value" statements
   to "setenv VAR value".

   1.  Download the GPL-licensed Qt/Mac library source code from
       <ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/contrib/qt-mac-free-3.1.2.sit>,
       untar in a convenient directory, cd to the top of the Qt source
       hierarcy, and:

     export QTDIR=`pwd` 
     patch -p0 < LYX-SOURCE-DIRECTORY/development/MacOSX/qt.patch
     sudo gcc_select 3.3 
     ./configure -static   [for Panther, use "./configure -static -lresolv"]
     make 
     rm lib/libqt.la

   2.  Download the LyX/Mac skeleton from
       <ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-mac-1.3.4-skeleton.tar.gz>
       and unpack it in /Applications.  Change the references to
       "1.3.4" in /Applications/LyX.app/Contents/Info.plist to
       "1.4.0".
 
   3.  Using the same terminal session you used to build the Qt
       library, cd to the top of the LyX source hierarchy, and:

     export LDFLAGS="-framework Carbon -framework OpenGL -framework AGL -framework QuickTime -lz"
     ./configure --with-frontend=qt --without-x --datadir=/Applications/LyX.app/Contents/Resources --bindir=/Applications/LyX.app/Contents/MacOS --mandir=/Applications/LyX.app/Contents/Resources/man
     make
     make install
     rm /Applications/LyX.app/Contents/Resources/LyX/images/lyx.xpm
