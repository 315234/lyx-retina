Building LyX/Mac-1.4.0

LyX/Mac is built from the LyX source, the GPL-licensed Trolltech
Qt/Mac library, and a custom application bundle.

You will need the MacOSX development tools. The procedure described
here builds LyX linked with a static Qt library. If you are using the
tcsh shell, change the "export VAR=value" statements to
"setenv VAR value".

1. Download the GPL-licensed Qt/Mac Free Edition library source code
from <http://www.trolltech.com/download/qt/mac.html>, untar in a
convenient directory, cd to the top of the Qt source hierarcy, and:

     export QTDIR=`pwd`
     sudo gcc_select 3.3
     ./configure -static -no-exceptions   [for Panther, use "./configure -static -no-exceptions -lresolv"]
     make
     rm lib/libqt.la

2. Download the LyX/Mac skeleton from
<ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-mac-1.3.5-skeleton.tar.gz> and
unpack it in /Applications. Change the references to "1.4.0" in
/Applications/LyX.app/Contents/Info.plist to reflect the current
version number.

3. Using the same terminal session you used to build the Qt library,
cd to the top of the LyX source hierarchy, and:

     export LDFLAGS="-framework Carbon -framework OpenGL -framework AGL -framework QuickTime -lz"
     ./configure --with-frontend=qt --without-x --datadir=/Applications/LyX.app/Contents/Resources --bindir=/Applications/LyX.app/Contents/MacOS --mandir=/Applications/LyX.app/Contents/Resources/man --enable-maintainer-mode --with-included-gettext --enable-optimization=-Os

     make
     make install
     rm /Applications/LyX.app/Contents/Resources/LyX/images/lyx.xpm

[Note that removing lyx.xpm -- the point of the last line above -- is
necessary to use the Mac OS X native icon files included in the
LyX/Mac skeleton.]
