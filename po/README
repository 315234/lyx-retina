Status
------

The intention here is to provide information about the status of the
different translation files.

   1998-02-03: no.po for Norwegian by Lars G. Bjønnes (larsbj@ifi.uio.no)
	Pretty much done except for some keyboard-shortcuts, and a few
	things that I don't know how to translate yet.
	Updated for 0.12.0

   1998-01-23: es.po, Spanish by Daniel Manrique and Alejandro Aguilar
        Sierra. Advanced but not yet complete. Send comments about this
	translation to (lyxesp@modelos1.atmosfcu.unam.mx) and get the 
	latest version from http://www.linux.org.mx/lyx/es.html.

   1999-04-30: da.po for Danish by Asger Alstrup (alstrup@diku.dk):
	Pretty much done for 1.0.2, except for some keyboard shortcuts.

   1998-07-27: Updated sv.po, Swedish by Joacim Persson (sp2joap1@ida.his.se)
	Complete, in the sense that it works. (except some shortcuts in a
	few hard-to-crack dialogs)
	
   1998-02-01: de.po, German by Peter Metternich and Peter Sütterlin
        Complete as of pre8, allthough some translations could be nicer.
        Shortcuts do work, allthough some are missing (not enough
        unique letters...).  Additional shortcut definition file 
        menus_de.bind available.

   1998-02-11: hu.po, Hungarian by Peter Kremer & Andras Kadar
        Menus and some simple dialog box are done. Additional shortcut
	definition file menus_hu.bind available.

   1998-11-27: fr.po, by Emmanuel Gureghian <gureghia@spi.lip6.fr>, with
        *slight* changes by Jean-Marc Lasgouttes. All strings are basically
        translated, but the keyboard shortcuts have not been updated and
	the translation could really be improved. Feel free to contact 
	Emmanuel if you want to help.

   1998-12-02: ru.po, by Victor Lavrenko <lyx@lavrenko.pp.ru>. Last updated
        on 1999-01-29. 

The status of the other files is unknown at this point in time, but
most should be pretty good.

How can I update an existing po file?
-------------------------------------

It requires a bit of work to get started, but once you are set up,
the procedure should be relatively easy:

1) Getting ready

Get and install gettext (available from ftp://alpha.gnu.org). Read the
documentation for gettext. Then get the latest LyX distribution including 
patches, and unpack it in your home directory. Read README in the LyX
distribution. Read the files in development/Code_rules/.
Check the mailing list archives to learn what is going on at the moment. 
Consider subscribing to the developer's mailing list.

2) Preparing a patch

Now do (if you want to update the no.po file):

        cp -R lyx-*.*.* lyx.new
		(which makes a copy of the source distribution for 
		 you to change)
	cd lyx.new/po/

        msgmerge no.po lyx.pot > no.pox
		(use no.pox as a temporary)
        emacs no.pox                           
		(using po-mode.)
	        (finish editing no.pox, save)
        msgfmt no.pox
        mv messages no.gmo
        mv no.pox no.po
        rm no.pox~

	(update the status list in this README file)

	cd ..

	(update CHANGES and maybe also lib/CREDITS)

	lyx.new/development/tools/makepatch lyx-*.*.* lyx.new
		(which will create a patch file)

3) Submitting the patch

	zcat *.patch.gz | less
		(to check that the patch is ok)

	Mail the patch along with an announcement mail to 
	lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org)

Thanks!

The LyX Team.
