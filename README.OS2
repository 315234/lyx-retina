These are temporary instructions from Shigeru Miyata <miyata@kusm.kyoto-u.ac.jp>
===========================================================================

(The top level) configure.cmd is obsoleted by.  Please follow the
step like this:

1. Install GNU m4, gnu?utils, aclocal/2, autoheader/2, automake/2,
   autoconf/2, perl, GNU patch and a UNIX type shell like pdksh.
2. Apply the patch development/OS2/quick_fix.patch
   // os2_defines.h needs a modification because bmtable.c is C.
   // Now it hits me, why don't we patch "test -x" (gnufutils)?
   // However, we can't modify the behavior of "test -f", so
   // it is still necessary to modify script files for LyX.
3. Install xforms 0.88 and rename
      forms.a   -> forms_d.a
      forms_s.a -> forms.a
   // Ever since 1.1.5pre1, you cannot link xforms 0.88 dynamically.
   // If you don't like this, please ask Holger Veit to export
   // fl_get_scrollbar_bounds, fl_get_scrollbar_increment and
   // fl_get_scrollbar_value from the DLL.  They're already there!
   // I will try to release xforms 0.89 ASAP.
4. Install Hung-Chi Chu's port of GNU gettext.  Other ports will
   not work.
5. Set environment variables
      MAKE_SHELL=sh
      LIBS=-lulib -lsocket -lbsd -lshm -lstdcpp
      CXXFLAGS=-g -O2 -m486 -Zmt -DOS2 -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions
   // ulib must be linked if we use static xforms library 0.88.
   // If xforms 0.89 is used -lulib must be removed from above.
   // Unless you are using pgcc, we use gcc rather than g++.
   // Hence stdc++ must be linked explicitely.  Also please
   // note that ld for pgcc often fails to link big executables
   // like unstripped lyx.exe
   // Due to a bug (actually a limitation) of autoconf/2,
   // you have to set CXXFLAGS explicitely in order to compile
   // CVS version newer than 11 Oct. 2000.
6. From sh prompt, type
      autogen.sh; rm -f config.cache
   and then
      configure --prefix=/XFree86 --datadir=/XFree86/lib/X11 --with-included-string
      x11make
   // Please do not use make.cmd  make.exe should be OK.
   // x11make.exe is the safest choice
   // While you are running configure, make sure that it is not
   // a background process to other CPU intensive processes.
   // While OS/2 kernel is much more efficient, faster and
   // more responsive than other systems like LINUX (you can
   // easily *FEEL* this if you stop PM/WPS and run XFree86
   // only), its TTY interface is lousy, to say the least.
   // If the synchronization to the children breaks, configure
   // often detects wrongfully.

7. If you are going to make a binary distribution, you have
   to prepare lib/configure.cmd noweb2lyx.cmd and reLyX.cmd,
   since end users may not have a UNIX type shell installed.
   In order to create noweb2lyx.cmd and reLyX.cmd, first rename
   noweb2lyx and reLyX and open them in a text editor.  You
   have to remove hardcoded path in the first line:
#!perl
   Also in reLyX.cmd, $lyxdir should be changed to include the
   drive letter (the line 21):
$lyxdir = "$ENV{X11ROOT}/XFree86/lib/X11/lyx";
   Finally, prepend a line
extproc perl.exe -S
   so that cmd.exe pass the execution control to perl.
   // I know configure.cmd had done this automatically.
   // So you can compare the result with the scripts in 1.0.4
   // distribution.

README file for OS/2 version of LyX 1.0.1
by Shigeru Miyata <miyata@kusm.kyoto-u.ac.jp>
modified by Arnd Hanses <Arnd.H.Hanses@rz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
##############################################################

- This README.OS2 addresses experienced users of XFree86 and
  LyX on OS/2 and covers in very short form the steps for
  updating (installing) LyX.

- For general information on LyX please refer to the generic
  README. For generic compiling instructions refer to INSTALL.

- For a more detailed step by step guide on installing (or compiling)
  LyX and other related useful (or even necessary) optional programs
  on OS/2 please refer to INSTALL.OS2. If you are not already an
  experienced user of LyX an OS/2 you are advised to read it.

- For a description of the binary distribution and any necessary
  support libraries please refer to README.bin, which comes with the
  binary distribution.


LyX has been ported to OS/2 with XFree86 by Shigeru Miyata and
has been installed and used successfully by many people.
Unfortunately there is yet no easy to install and complete distribu-
tion of XFree86-related software for OS/2. Despite increasing popula-
rity of X on OS/2, extensive printed documentation about XFree/2 and
related programs like LyX is still not available. So you will
have to study the available documentation (man pages, READMEs, faq,
etc.) thoroughly to avoid unnecessary grief for you and for other
people, trying to help you on the net. Nevertheless, there are
existing tutorials and manuals covering X on UNIX family operating
systems, which do contain some valuable information even for X on
OS/2.
    [A hint as a starting point for users speaking German:
	http://www.rrzn-uni-hannover.de/Umdrucke/WSC.5/WSC5_1.html].

This release is considered to be stable for general use, but - like
any other piece of software - certainly is not bug free.
So take the usual precautions like adopting a regular backup policy.
Standard disclaimers of non liability apply.

As this is a voluntary project with a large number of contributions
by many people, hints and bug fixes to the program and/or the
documentation are always appreciated and thoroughly considered. If
you have the necessary skills (or want to take the chance to acquire
them) for programming in LaTeX or C++ you can become a LyX developer.
You can support further development by making a donation, if you feel
that LyX made your live a bit easier or you want to support open source
software.
Please refer to the links at www.lyx.org for details.

==============================================================

	A. Quick Update:
	   ------------

0) Only for update: If you are upgrading from LyX v. 0.12.0,
   any old documentation files in %HOME%/.lyx/doc/ and
   %X11ROOT%/XFree86/lib/X11/lyx/doc should be removed before
   unpacking (since they are read only). You might wish to make
   a backup, if you want to keep old docs.

1) Unpack the archive at %X11ROOT%.

2) Run lyx and let the program copy configuration files to
	%HOME%\.lyx\.

3) If you don't have %HOME%\.lyx\lyxrc then move
   %X11ROOT%\XFree86\lyxrc.example to %HOME%\.lyx\lyxrc.
   If updating, make a backup of old version, if you want.
   Read README and WHATSNEW about updating and run
   Options->Reconfigure as indicated.

4) Verify if LYX is able to find the programs mentioned
   in %HOME%\.lyx\lyxrc and in %HOME%\.lyx\lyxrc.defaults; if not,
   change name and path as required.

   Note: Remember to repeat the check after any 'Reconfigure'!

5) In config.sys SET LANG and LANGUAGE according to
   your preferences. Beware: All programs supporting local
   languages will be affected, e.g.:

SET LANG=de_DE		rem german helpfiles will be used
SET LANGUAGE=de_DE	rem german menus and messages

6) Restart OS/2 and run LyX. Have fun!



	B. Help/Problems:
	   -------------

* Please refer to the manpage (type 'man lyx' on the command line or
  use 'xman')

* If you encounter apparently OS/2 specific bugs, (i.e. bugs not
  already mentioned in the documentation or the buglist) you can report
  them to the XFree86/OS2 mailing list as well as to the LyX developer
  mailing list.

* For any questions on using LyX please subscribe to the the LyX user
  mailing list.

  - To subscribe to the XFree86 mailing list send mail to
      majordomo@borneo.gmd.de
    with "subscribe" as the subject.
    To contribute to the mailing list, mail to
      xfreeos2@borneo.gmd.de

  - For subscription to lyx-user list (general help on LyX) go to
	http://www.lyx.org
    and search for subscription info.

* Hints:
  -----
1. To prevent 'file not found' with EmTeX and some non-US versions
   of Warp, I recommend:

	1) In filenames use only A-Z, a-z, 1-9.
	
	2) Use a recent LaTeX package inputenc.sty. Select
	   Layout->Document->Encoding:latin1, so that LyX adds
	   the LaTeX command '\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}'.

2. LaTeX import occasionally produces buggy *.lyx files. LyX tries
   to save data in case of problems (and does a good job here),
   but I recommend:

	To import LaTeX close down and restart LyX (or close all
	documents, you are working on) and try the import, so that
	in case of any problems none of your existing documents will
	be affected.

3. Inline preview of inline images sometimes does not show the
   image: If you want to preview the image, just click on it and
   select fullscreen preview.

4. Some XFree/2 programs (as ported from UNIX) expect a sh.exe
   in \bin directory: I recommend to install sh.exe of pdksh.zip
   in x:\bin (x: drive of %X11ROOT%). To work around problems you
   can try the commands
	set EMXSHELL=x:\bin\sh.exe
   before starting the programs. As far as I know, LyX runs without
   problems in this way.


Some suggestions in case of problems:
------------------------------------
1) Please check, if your x:\xfree86\lib does appear correctly in
   libpath.

2) Please check against the file list, if you did install all files of
   the distribution.

3) Remove all installed files and
	%.home%/.lyx/
   and perform a
	chkdsk /f
   and a consistency check of your lyx binary package (unzip -tv
   foo.zip).

4) Reinstall the complete package and check out if everything appears,
   no truncated files, no crc errors, etc.

5) Run
	lyx -dbg 1026 >lyxerrors.log 2>&1
   or, if you have tee.exe,
	lyx -dbg 1026 2>&1|tee lyxerrors.log
  and watch out for any error messages. Report any remaining problems.
  As this is a completely voluntary project, everybody involved will be
  grateful for user efforts like detailed bug reports, suggestions,
  fixes, additions to the documentation, etc.

6) Have fun! (I'm sure).


	C. Tips for Advanced Users:
	   -----------------------
* You can start LyX automatically by adding
	'start/min/n xconsole.exe'
	'set EMXSHELL=x:\bin\sh.exe'
	'start/min/n lyx >/dev/console$ 2>&1'
  to xinitrc.cmd before the line that invokes the
  window manager, so that LyX' messages appear in the
  console window and LyX appears in the pm-task list.

* You can start LyX automatically by adding
	'detach xconsole.exe'
	'detach lyx >/dev/console$ 2>&1'
  to xinitrc.cmd before the line that invokes the
  window manager, so that LyX' messages appear in the
  console window and LyX does not appear in the PM task list.
