Pre-release of LyX version 2.0.0 (beta 2)
==========================================

We are pleased to announce the second public pre-release of LyX 2.0.0.

Due to the many reports we received, support for polyglossia, XeTeX's new
language interface and babel replacement, has been added. Apart from this
better support for sub/superscript has been added and externally launched
documents are now possible to load in an already running LyX instance.

Please report the problems and bugs at our lists or bug tracker and
also note that this release is for testing purposes only. Users are
encouraged to use current 1.6 stable release for any serious work.

Tarballs and binaries can be found at ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/devel/

LyX 2.0.0 will be culmination of more than two years of hard work
and you can find an overview of the new features here:

developers' mailing list (lyx-devel at lists.lyx.org), or open a bug

documentation that comes with LyX and http://wiki.lyx.org.

We hope you will enjoy the result!
