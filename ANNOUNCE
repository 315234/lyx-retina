Pre-release of LyX version 2.0.0 (beta 1)
==========================================

We are pleased to announce the first public pre-release of LyX 2.0.0.
Development moved to the beta phase which basically means we will no more
include new features and focus on polishing the current ones.
We are thus grateful for any feedback you sent us regarding the bugs you
encounter while testing the beta release. Except trying new features
this is also good time to check that your favorite old files works with
the new release as expected.

Please note that this release is for testing purposes only, users are
encouraged to use current 1.6 stable release for any serious work.

Tarballs and binaries can be found at ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/devel/

LyX 2.0.0 will be culmination of more than two years of hard work
and you can find an overview of the new features here:
