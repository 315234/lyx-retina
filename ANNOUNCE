Public release of LyX version 1.6.0
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.6.0.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

LyX 1.6.0 is the culmination of 15 months of hard work since the
release of the LyX 1.5.0. We sincerely hope you will enjoy the result.

The new features in LyX 1.6 are detailed in
http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/NewInLyX16

The file RELEASE-NOTES lists some known issues with this release
compared to the current stable release (LyX 1.5.6). An updated list of
issues might later be found at http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/ReleaseNotes
