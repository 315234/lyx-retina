Pre-release of LyX version 2.0.0 (beta 4)
==========================================

We are pleased to announce the fourth public pre-release of LyX 2.0.0.

Except usual bugfixing we fixed random crashes connected with the
new background export and compilation feature.

As far as new features is considered it is now possible to set the
table width, customize the language package per document and
export LyX files as a single archive containing linked material
(e.g. images) directly via export menu.

Since this is most probably the last beta release we also added
convertor for old (1.6) preference files which are automatically
checked on the startup now.

Please report the problems and bugs at our lists or bug tracker and
also note that this release is for testing purposes only. Users are
encouraged to use current 1.6 stable release for any serious work.

Tarballs and binaries can be found at ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/devel/
Note that windows installers might not appear for this release.

LyX 2.0.0 will be culmination of more than two years of hard work
