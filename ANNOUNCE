Pre-release of LyX version 2.0.0 (beta 3)
==========================================

We are pleased to announce the third public pre-release of LyX 2.0.0.

Except usual bugfixing we addressed long-term slowness issues during this
cycle, in particular we tried to improve performance of the following areas:
* exporting of longer documents
* editing of documents with rich inset structure
* editing with opened outliner.

Please report the problems and bugs at our lists or bug tracker and
also note that this release is for testing purposes only. Users are
encouraged to use current 1.6 stable release for any serious work.

Tarballs and binaries can be found at ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/devel/

LyX 2.0.0 will be culmination of more than two years of hard work
and you can find an overview of the new features here:
