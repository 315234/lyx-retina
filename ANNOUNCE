Public release of LyX version 1.6.0 (release candidate 5)
=========================================================

We are pleased to announce the fifth release candidate of LyX 1.6.0.

LyX 1.6.0 will be the culmination of 15 months of hard work since the
release of the LyX 1.5 series. We sincerely hope you will enjoy the
result.

This is the last planned release candidate. In order to guarantee a
stable release of LyX 1.6.0 there are very few changes when compared
with the last release candidate (rc4).
The changes committed refer to bug and performance fixes and there are
no known regressions compared to any of the previous release
candidates.

As usual with a major release, a lot of work that is not directly
visible has taken place. The core of LyX has seen more cleanups and
some of the new features are the direct results of this work.

The new features in LyX 1.6 are detailed in
http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/NewInLyX16

The file RELEASE-NOTES lists some known issues with this release
compared to the current stable release (LyX 1.5.6). An updated list of
issues might later be found at http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/ReleaseNotes


In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with page
   boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's legendary
   TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output -- or
   richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks like
   nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs, all
   looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes 'eating'
   your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux and the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.6.0rc5 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/devel/lyx-1.6.0rc5.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/devel/lyx-1.6.0rc5.tar.bz2

Note that due to the amount of change, no patch is provided to upgrade
from version 1.5.6.

Prebuilt binaries (rpms for linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows
installers) should soon be available at
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/devel/

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.6.0rc5, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel at lists.lyx.org), or open
a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a question,
first check out http://wiki.lyx.org/FAQ/. If you can't find the answer there,
e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users at lists.lyx.org).

Enjoy!

The LyX team.
