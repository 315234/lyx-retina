Public release of LyX version 2.0.0
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 2.0.0.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

You can download LyX 2.0.0 from http://www.lyx.org/Download

LyX 2.0.0 is the culmination of two and half years of hard work and
you can find an overview of the new features here:

http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/NewInLyX20

We hope you will enjoy the result!

The file RELEASE-NOTES lists some known issues and problems compared
to the current stable releases (LyX 1.6). We strongly recommend to read
this file for packagers of LyX on various platforms and distributions.

As with any major release we come with lot of new features but also
bugs. If you think you found a bug in LyX 2.0.0, either e-mail the LyX
developers' mailing list (lyx-devel at lists.lyx.org), or open a bug
report at http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX and http://wiki.lyx.org.
If you can't find the answer there, e-mail the LyX users' list
(lyx-users at lists.lyx.org).

The LyX team.
