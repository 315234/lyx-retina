Release of LyX version 2.0.0 (release candidate 1)
==================================================

We are pleased to announce the first release candidate of LyX 2.0.0.

Since the last beta releases became stable enough for a regular work
we switched to release candidate, freezed new development and focused
on bugfixing to make the final release even more polished.

The file RELEASE-NOTES lists some known issues and problems compared
to the current stable releases (LyX 1.6). We strongly recommend to read
this file for packagers of LyX on various platforms and distributions.

As with any major release we come with lot of new features but also
bugs -- so while we encourage curious users to test this release, people
who rely on solid and stable application should stay with 1.6 releases.
Please report the problems and bugs at our lists or bug tracker.

Tarballs and binaries can be found at ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/devel/

LyX 2.0.0 will be culmination of more than two years of hard work
and you can find an overview of the new features here:

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX and http://wiki.lyx.org.

We hope you will enjoy the result!
