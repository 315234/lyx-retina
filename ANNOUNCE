Public release of LyX version 1.1.6pre
===================================

What is LyX?
------------

LyX is an advanced open-source "document processor". Unlike standard
word processors, LyX encourages writing based on the structure of your
documents, not their appearance, It lets you concentrate on writing,
leaving details of visual layout to the software.

With the familiar face of a WISYWIG word processor, LyX produces high
quality, professional output -- using LaTeX, an industrial
strength typesetting engine. No knowledge of LaTeX is required to
use LyX; however, there is also a "TeX mode" which allows you to enter
plain LaTeX commands.

All in all, LyX is a complete environment for writing documents. It has
superior support for scientific writing, but works well for any kind of
document.

What can LyX do?
----------------

A very incomplete feature list:

- "standard" word processing: fonts, cut & paste, infinite undo...
- footnotes, citations, cross-referencing, faxes, spellchecking
- almost any math expression (with a simple, but powerfull interface)
- automatic, multilevel outline support (enumerated or bullets)
- tables and embedded postscript figures support
- import LaTeX or ASCII
- export LaTeX, ASCII, DVI, PostScript, LinuxDoc-SGML, DocBook-SGML
- fair support for non-English documents and/or menus
- extensive documentation, including a tutorial
- version control using RCS (some support for CVS)

How stable is LyX?
