Compiling and installing LyX
============================

Quick compilation guide
-----------------------

These four steps will compile, test and install LyX:

	1) ./configure
	   configures LyX to your system.

	2) make
	   compiles the program.

	3) src/lyx
	   runs the program so you can check it out.

	4) make install
	   will install it. You can use "make install-strip" instead
           if you want a smaller binary. 


Note for CVS checkouts
----------------------

If you have checked this out from CVS, you need to have
automake, autoconf, and gettext installed.  Then,
type "./autogen.sh" to build the needed configuration
files and proceed as stated below.

You will also probably need GNU m4 (perhaps installed as gm4).
 
Requirements
------------

First of all, you will also need a recent C++ compiler, where recent
means that the compilers are close to C++ standard conforming.
Compilers that are known to compile LyX are egcs 1.1.x, gcc 2.95.x and
later, and Digital C++ version 6.1 and later. Please tell us your
experience with other compilers. It is _not_ possible to compile LyX
with gcc 2.7.x and 2.8.x, and this is not likely to change in the
future.

Note that, contrary to LyX 1.0.x, LyX 1.2.x makes great use of C++
Standard Template Library (STL); this means that gcc users will have
to install the relevant libstdc++ library to be able to compile this
version.

Both an Xforms and Xpm libraries should be installed to compile LyX.
It is imperative that you have the correct versions of these
libraries, and their associated header files.

As of LyX version 1.2.0, you will need to have Xforms library and
header version 0.88 or 0.89. Version 0.89.6 is the one which works
best, but the old stable 0.88.1 version is still supported. On some
systems, such as linux ELF, there are shared library versions of the
Xforms library, which require an installation step to configure the
system.

Xforms is available (free) only in binary format, source code is not
available.  If it is not available for your machine, contact the Xforms
developers to request a version for your system.  You can get it from

    http://world.std.com/~xforms/
    ftp://ncmir.ucsd.edu/pub/xforms/
    ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/xforms/
    ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/unix/X11/gui/xforms
    ftp://ftp.cs.ruu.nl/pub/XFORMS/

If you use a rpm-based linux distribution, such as RedHat or Mandrake,
we recommend that you grab a version of xforms from
  ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/contrib 
as the rpm packages commonly found are compiled against glibc 2.0
instead of 2.[12], and this causes occasional crashes.

In addition, you must have libXpm version 4.7 or newer.

Note that the Qt and Gnome frontends are still under development, and
as a result are only useful if you want to help out with testing and
development.
 
If you make modifications to files in src/ (for example by applying a
patch), you will need to have the GNU gettext package installed, due
to some dependencies in the makefiles. You can find the latest version
from:

    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gettext-0.10.xx.tar.gz.

LyX contains a hack to work around this, but you should not rely too
much on it.

To use the thesaurus, you will need to install libAikSaurus, available
from :

    http://aiken.clan11.com/aiksaurus/ 
 
Finally, the two following programs should be available at
configuration time:

  o Perl (at least 5.002) is needed for the reLyX script. reLyX will
    not be installed if perl is not found.  If the environment
    variable PERL is set to point to some program, this value will be
    used, even if the program does no exist (this can be useful if
    the machine on which LyX is built is not the one where it will
    run). 

  o LaTeX2e should be correctly setup for the user you are logged in
    as. Otherwise, LyX will not be able to run a number of tests. Note
    that users can run these tests manually with Edit>Reconfigure.


Creating the Makefile
---------------------

LyX can be configured using GNU autoconf utility which attempts to guess 
the configuration needed to suit your system.  The standard way to use it 
is described in the file INSTALL.autoconf.  In most cases you will be able 
to create the Makefile by typing

  ./configure

For more complicated cases, LyX configure takes the following specific
flags:

  o --with-extra-lib=DIRECTORY that specifies the path where LyX will find
    extra libraries (Xpm, xforms) it needs.  Defaults to NONE (i.e. search 
    in standard places).  You can specify several directories, separated
    by colons.

  o --with-extra-inc=DIRECTORY that gives the place where LyX will find
    xforms headers.  Defaults to NONE (i.e.  search in standard places).
    You can specify several directories, separated by colons.

  o --with-extra-prefix[=DIRECTORY] that is equivalent to
       --with-extra-lib=DIRECTORY/lib --with-extra-inc=DIRECTORY/include
    If DIRECTORY is not specified, the current prefix is used.

  o --with-version-suffix will install LyX as lyx-<version>, e.g. lyx-1.2.0
    The LyX data directory will be something like <whatever>/lyx-1.2.0/.
    Additionally your user configuration files will be found in e.g.
    $HOME/.lyx-1.2.0

    You can use this feature to install more than one version of LyX on
    the same system. You can optionally specify a "version" of your own,
    by doing something like : ./configure --with-version-suffix=-latestcvs

    Note that the standard configure options --program-prefix,--program-suffix
    and the others will not affect the shared LyX directory etc. so it
    is recommended that you use --with-version-suffix (or --prefix) instead.

  o --enable-optimization=VALUE enables you to set optimization to a
    higher level as the default (-O), for example --enable-optimization=-O3.

  o --disable-optimization - you can use this to disable compiler
    optimization of LyX. The compile may be much quicker with some
    compilers, but LyX will run more slowly. 
 
There are also flags to control the internationalization support in
LyX:

  o --disable-nls suppresses all internationalization support,
    yielding a somewhat smaller code. 

  o --with-included-gettext forces the use of the included GNU gettext
    library, although you might have another one installed.

  o --with-catgets allows to use the catget() functions which can
    exist on your system.  This can cause problems, though. Use with
    care.

  o You can also set the environment variable LINGUAS to a list of
    language in case ou do not want to install all the translation 
    files. For example, if you are only interested in German and
    Finnish, you can type (with sh or bash)
        export LINGUAS='de fi'
    before running configure.

Moreover, the following generic configure flags may be useful:

  o --prefix=DIRECTORY specifies the root directory to use for
    installation. [defaults to /usr/local]

  o --datadir=DIRECTORY gives the directory where all extra LyX 
    files (lyxrc example, documentation, templates and layouts
    definitions) will be installed. 
    [defaults to ${prefix}/share/lyx${program_suffix}]

  o --bindir=DIRECTORY gives the directory where the lyx binary
    will be installed. [defaults to ${prefix}/bin]

  o --mandir=DIRECTORY gives the directory where the man pages will go.
    [defaults to ${prefix}/man]

Note that the --with-extra-* commands are not really robust when it
comes to use of relative paths.  If you really want to use a relative path
here, you can prepend it with "`pwd`/". 

If you do not like the default compile flags used (-g -O2 on gcc), you can 
set CXXFLAGS variable to other values as follows:

  o CXXFLAGS='-O2' (sh, bash)
  o setenv CXXFLAGS '-O2' (csh, tcsh)

Similarly, if you want to force the use of some specific compiler, you can 
give a value to the CXX variable.

If you encounter problems, please read the section 'Problems' at the end of 
this file. 

In particular, the following options could be useful in some
desperate cases:

  o --enable-warnings that make the compiler output more warnings during
    the compilation of LyX.  Opposite is --disable-warnings.  By default,
    this flag is on for development versions only.

  o --enable-assertions that make the compiler generate run-time
    code which checks that some variables have sane values. Opposite
    is --disable-assertions.  By default, this flag is on for
    development versions only. 

  o --with-broken-headers that provides prototypes to replace functions
    not correctly defined in SunOS4 and SCO header files.  Its only effect is
    to suppress a few warnings.  It is autodetected by default.

  o --without-latex-config that disables the automatic detection of your
    latex configuration.  This detection is automatically disabled if
    latex cannot be found.  If you find that you have to use this
    flag, please report it as a bug. 

  o --without-liberty suppresses the detection of the -liberty library
    (see the section `Problems').


Compiling and installing LyX
----------------------------

Once you've got the Makefile created, you just have to type:

  make all
  make install

All should be OK ;)

Since the binaries with debug information tend to be huge (although
this does not affect the run-time memory footprint), you might want
to strip the lyx binary. In this case replace "make install" with

  make install-strip

BTW: in the images subdirectory there is also a small icon "lyx.xpm",
that can be used to display lyx-documents in filemanagers.

If configure fails for some strange reason
------------------------------------------

Even when configure fails, it creates a Makefile.  You always can check
the contents of this file, modify it and run 'make'.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
------------------------------------

You can compile LyX for more than one kind of computer at the same
time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their own
directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that supports
the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the directory where
you want the object files and executables to go and run the
`configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the source
code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile LyX for one architecture at a time in
the source code directory.  After you have installed LyX for one
architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Preparing a binary distribution for the use of others
------------------------------------------------------

  o Compile LyX with the right compiler switches for your
    architecture. Make sure you use the --without-latex-config switch
    of configure, since others might not be interested by your
    configuration :-) 

  o Create a file README.bin describing your distribution and
    referring to *you* if problems arise. As a model, you can use the 
    file development/tools/README.bin.example, which can be a good
    starting point. 

  o Type `make bindist'. This will create a file
    lyx-1.xx.yy-bin.tar.gz. Rename it to reflect you architecture 
    and the peculiarities of your build (e.g. static vs. dynamic).

  o Check that everything is correct by unpacking the distribution 
    in some private place and running it. In particular, check the 
    output of `ldd lyx' to know which libraries are really needed.

  o Upload your binary file to ftp.devel.lyx.org:/pub/incoming, and
    notify larsbj@lyx.org.  


Problems
--------

This section provides several hints that have been submitted by LyX
team member or users to help compiling on some particular
architectures. If you find that some of this hints are wrong, please
notify us.

  o If you have problems indicating that configure cannot find a part of
    the xforms or Xpm library, use the --with-extra-lib and --with-extra-inc 
    options of configure to specify where these libraries reside.  

  o Configure will seemingly fail to find xpm.h and forms.h on linux
    if the kernel headers are not available. Two cases are possible: 

      - you have not installed the kernel sources. Then you should
        install them or at least the kernel-headers package (or
        whatever it is called in your distribution).

      - you have the sources, but you did a 'make mrproper' in the
	kernel directory (this  this removes some symbolic links that
	are needed for compilation). A 'make symlinks' in linux kernel
	sources fixes that. 

  o if you are using RedHat Linux 7.x, you must make sure you have the
    latest updated gcc and related packages installed (at least -85),
    or LyX will not compile or will be mis-compiled.
 
  o if you get an error message when compiling LyX that looks like this :

    ../../src/minibuffer.h:17: using directive `Object' introduced
    ambiguous type `_ObjectRec *'

    then you need to upgrade the version of the xforms library you have
    installed.

  o On solaris 2.6, you may have to compile with --with-included-string
    if compiling with gcc 2.95.2.

  o According to David Sundqvist <David_Sundqvist@vd.volvo.se>, some
    changes are needed to compile with aCC on HP-UX 10.20. These are the
    relevant changes in the makefile (with comments tagged on):  

    CXX = /opt/aCC/bin/aCC 
    CXXFLAGS = -O +inst_none # The aCC compiler tries to run instantiations
                             # which currently break.

    LIBS = -lforms -lXpm  -lSM -lICE -lc -lm -lX11 -lCsup # must link with Csup
    LDFLAGS = -L/opt/aCC/lib # perhaps not needed.

  o LyX can be compiled on Tru64 Unix with either GNU's gcc or the default
    Compaq cxx compiler.

    There are no Alpha-specific problems with gcc.

    The following notes all refer to compilation with the Compaq cxx compiler.

    LyX cannot be compiled on Tru64 Unix 4.0d or 4.0e with the default cxx
    compiler. You should upgrade to at least cxx V6.2, to be found at
    ftp::/ftp.compaq.com/pub/products/C-CXX/tru64/cxx/CXX622V40.tar. Users
    running Tru64 Unix 4.0f and greater should have no real problems compiling
    LyX.

    cxx V6.2 will compile LyX out of the box.
    cxx V6.3-020 is also known to work, although there is a bug in
    /usr/include/cxx/deque. See Angus Leeming <leeming@lyx.org> for the
    patch.
    At the time of writing, cxx V6.5-026 is the latest cxx compiler. It is
    /not/ recommended. Not only do the bugs in the system header files still
    exist, but the compiler itself appears to be both buggy and extremely
    bloated (trebles the size of the stripped LyX binary).

    In order to compile LyX with the cxx compiler, you should run configure
    with the following flags:
	CXX='cxx -std strict_ansi'
	CXXFLAGS='-nopure_cname -nocleanup -ptr /tmp/lyx_cxx_repository -O2'
	CC='cc -std1'
    The -nopure_cname flag is needed for compilers V6.3 and above because
    LyX makes use of functions like popen, pclose that are defined in the
    c version of <stdio.h> but are not formally part of any c/c++ standard.
    They are not, therefore, included in the <cstdio> header file.
