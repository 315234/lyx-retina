This file lists interface changes that might affect users in 1.5.0 and
also some known problems in LyX 1.5.0 that did not occur in
1.4.4. Note that fixes are available for many of these, but they have
not yet been applied because of incomplete testing.


Interface changes
-----------------

Some of the LyX functions have changed names :


Known issues with version 1.5.0
------------------------------------

- User layout files must be converted to UTF-8

In previous version, layout styles were allowed to use non-ASCII names
using the local encodings. LyX-1.5 now assumes that all layout files are
UTF-8 encoded. This means that non-ASCII style names are still allowed
but they nust be valid UTF-8 strings. One way of doing the conversion
is to use iconv. Using bash, the script below should work:

cd /path/to/layouts
for l in *
do
  cp $l tmp.txt
  iconv -f latin1 -t utf8 tmp.txt -o $l
done
rm tmp.txt

- Cursor restoration problems with Multiple-View

When using multiple Windows to edit different parts of the
same document, the cursor position is sometimes not correctly restored
when you switch from one view to the other.
