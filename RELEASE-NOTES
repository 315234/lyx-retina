This file lists interface changes that might affect users in 2.0.0, some 
known problems in LyX 2.0.0 and some things you have to take into account
when upgrading from earlier versions to a version of the 2.0.x series.
Note that fixes are available for some of these, but they have not yet
been applied because of incomplete testing.


Interface changes
-----------------

There have been some changes to the LyX command line. There is a new option 
"--batch" that causes LyX to run the given commands without opening a GUI 
window. Thus, something like:
    lyx --batch -x "buffer-print printer default dvips" myfile.lyx
will cause LyX to print myfile.lyx to the default printer, using dvips and 
the default print settings (which, of course, have to have been configured 
already). At present, not many commands can be used this way, but there will
be more eventually.

The following variables are obsoleted in 2.0

- \plaintext_roff_command (was not used anymore)

- \personal_dictionary, \spell_command, \use_input_encoding,
  \use_personal_dictionary and \use_spell_lib (ispell support has been
  removed)

- \spellchecker_use_alt_lang and \use_escape_chars (actually not used
  by the UI, and it is as simple to check whether the relevant
  variable is empty)

- \custom_export_command and \custom_export_format


The following new LyX functions have been introduced:

- LFUN_WORD_FINDAD ("word-findadv").

- LFUN_REGEXP_MODE ("regexp-mode").

- LFUN_PHANTOM_INSERT ("phantom-insert").

- LFUN_INSET_BEGIN ("inset-begin").

- LFUN_INSET_END (""inset-end"").

- LFUN_INSET_BEGIN_SELECT ("inset-begin-select").

- LFUN_INSET_END_SELECT ("inset-end-select").

- LFUN_CHANGE_PREVIOUS ("change-previous").

- LFUN_LABEL_INSERT_AS_REF ("label-insert-as-reference").

- LFUN_SECTION_SELECT ("section-select").

- LFUN_FONT_UNDERLINE ("font-underline").

- LFUN_FONT_STRIKEOUT ("font-strikeout").

- LFUN_FONT_UULINE ("font-underunderline").

- LFUN_FONT_UWAVE ("font-underwave").


The following LyX functions have been removed:

- LFUN_NEXT_INSET_TOGGLE ("next-inset-toggle"): use "inset-toggle" instead.

The following LyX functions have been changed:

- LFUN_INSET_TOGGLE ("inset-toggle"): For some insets, this function was used 
  to show the settings dialog. This is no longer possible and one should use
  inset-settings for this purpose.
 
- LFUN_WORD_REPLACE ("word-replace"): The replacement and searched strings
  arguments have been inverted in order to allow the replacement of the word
  at current cursor position, even if it is not selected.

TODO
----
- Somebody should create a rc2rc script...
  http://www.lyx.org/trac/changeset/27531
  
- some summary about 3rd party programs additions/removals should be
  written for packagers (eg aiksauraus, libtool).
