This file lists interface changes that might affect users in 1.6.0, some 
known problems in LyX 1.6.0 and some things you have to take into account
when upgrading from earlier versions to a version of the 1.6.x series.
Note that fixes are available for some of these, but they have not yet
been applied because of incomplete testing.


Interface changes
-----------------

The external template format recognize now a new tag: 'Preview'. This tag is
used to define how an external material should be previewed in LyX. For more 
detail, see the 'external_templates' file in the resource directory of LyX.

LyX 1.6.0 introduces support for the pLaTeX distribution which provides extended
language and script support for Japanese. The language "Japanese" now uses this
new method. Japanese support via the CJK package is still available, but has been
renamed to "Japanese (CJK)". Old documents continue to use the CJK method.
Also cf. the "known issues" section for some remaining problems.

Some of the LyX functions have changed names:

- A new LFUN_SPECIALCHAR_INSERT has been implemented that obsoletes the
  different LFUNs for single special characters:

  * LFUN_HYPHENATION_POINT_INSERT: removed. "hyphenation-point-insert" 
    has been replaced by "specialchar-insert hyphenation-point"

  "newline-insert", and it now allows two options: "newline-insert newline" inserts
  a \newline, "newline-insert linebreak" inserts a \linebreak.

- The function LFUN_PAGEBREAK_INSERT, "pagebreak-insert" has been renamed to
  LFUN_NEWPAGE_INSERT, "newpage-insert". It obsololetes the following functions:

  one's having to open LyX and activate the branch manually.

Known issues in version 1.6.0
------------------------------------

- New pLaTeX support for Japanese:
  * Documents using this method can be backported to 1.5 in pricipal, but
    the backported documents are not guaranteed to work, since 1.5 falls
    back to the CJK package; expect the output to differ.
  * pLaTeX provides a Japanese variant of BibTeX named "jbibtex", which will
    be selected automatically by LyX. If you run into problems with this or 
    if you need to use an alternative BibTeX program, you can change this
    setting in the LyX preferences (Output->LaTeX->BibTeX command).
