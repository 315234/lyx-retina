This file lists interface changes that might affect users in 2.0.0, some 
known problems in LyX 2.0.0 and some things you have to take into account
when upgrading from earlier versions to a version of the 2.0.x series.
Note that fixes are available for some of these, but they have not yet
been applied because of incomplete testing.


Interface changes
-----------------

There have been some changes to the LyX command line. There is a new option 
"--batch" that causes LyX to run the given commands without opening a GUI 
window. Thus, something like:
    lyx -batch -x "buffer-print printer default dvips" myfile.lyx
will cause LyX to print myfile.lyx to the default printer, using dvips and 
the default print settings (which, of course, have to have been configured 
already). At present, not many commands can be used this way, but there will
be more eventually.

Bash completion script was added to the tarball.

The following pref variables were changed in 2.0:

- \language_package was renamed to \language_custom_package

- \language_use_babel (bool) has been replaced by 
  \language_package_selection, which can be
  0 (automatic selection)
  1 (always use babel)
  2 custom (use the custom package defined by
    \language_custom_package)
  3 none (equivalent to former \language_use_babel false)

The following pref variables are obsoleted in 2.0:

- \plaintext_roff_command (was not used anymore)

- \personal_dictionary, \spell_command, \use_input_encoding,
  \use_personal_dictionary and \use_spell_lib (ispell support has been
  removed)

- \spellchecker_use_alt_lang and \use_escape_chars (actually not used
  by the UI, and it is as simple to check whether the relevant
  variable is empty)

- \custom_export_command and \custom_export_format


The following new LyX functions have been introduced:

- LFUN_WORD_FINDAD ("word-findadv").

- LFUN_REGEXP_MODE ("regexp-mode").

- LFUN_PHANTOM_INSERT ("phantom-insert").

- LFUN_INSET_BEGIN ("inset-begin").

- LFUN_INSET_END (""inset-end"").

- LFUN_INSET_BEGIN_SELECT ("inset-begin-select").

- LFUN_INSET_END_SELECT ("inset-end-select").

- LFUN_CHANGE_PREVIOUS ("change-previous").

- LFUN_LABEL_INSERT_AS_REF ("label-insert-as-reference").

- LFUN_SECTION_SELECT ("section-select").

- LFUN_FONT_UNDERLINE ("font-underline").

- LFUN_FONT_STRIKEOUT ("font-strikeout").

- LFUN_FONT_UULINE ("font-underunderline").

- LFUN_FONT_UWAVE ("font-underwave").

- LFUN_BRANCHES_RENAME ("branches-rename").

- LFUN_BRANCH_ADD_INSERT ("branch-add-insert").

- LFUN_BUFFER_CLOSE_ALL ("buffer-close-all").

- LFUN_INSET_FORALL ("inset-forall").

- LFUN_DEBUG_LEVEL_SET ("debug-level-set").

- LFUN_INSET_SELECT_ALL ("inset-select-all").

- LFUN_MATH_AMS_MATRIX ("math-ams-matrix").

- LFUN_VC_COMPARE ("vc-compare").

- LFUN_SPELLING_ADD ("spelling-add").

- LFUN_SPELLING_IGNORE ("spelling-ignore").

- LFUN_SPELLING_REMOVE ("spelling-remove").

- LFUN_PREVIEW_INSERT ("preview-insert").

- LFUN_FORWARD_SEARCH ("forward-search").

- LFUN_INSET_COPY_AS ("inset-copy-as").

- LFUN_BUFFER_TOGGLE_OUTPUT_SYNC ("buffer-toggle-output-sync").


The following LyX functions have been removed:

- LFUN_NEXT_INSET_TOGGLE ("next-inset-toggle"): use "inset-toggle" instead.

- LFUN_NEXT_INSET_MODIFY ("next-inset-modify"): use "inset-modify" instead.

- LFUN_PARAGRAPH_SPACING ("paragraph-spacing"): use "paragraph-params" instead.

- LFUN_NOTES_MUTATE ("notes-mutate"): replace
    notes-mutate <SOURCE> <TARGET>
  with the more general function inset-forall
    inset-forall Note:<SOURCE> inset-modify note Note <TARGET>

- LFUN_ALL_INSETS_TOGGLE ("all-insets-toggle"): replace
    all-insets-toggle <ACTION> <TARGET>
    all-insets-toggle <ACTION>
  with the more generic function inset-forall
    inset-forall <TARGET> inset-toggle <ACTION>
    inset-forall * inset-toggle <ACTION>
  There is a difference in the <TARGET> parameter, which is would be
  like "note" in the first case and "Note" in the second.

- LFUN_TABULAR_FEATURE ("tabular-feature"): use "inset-modify" instead.
  I.e., "tabular-feature FEATURE <ARGS>" becomes:
    inset-modify tabular FEATURE <ARGS>

- LFUN_LINE_INSERT ("line-insert"): use "inset-insert line" instead. For
  something close to the previous default, use:
    inset-insert line rule height 0.25ex width 100col% \\end_inset
  This is necessary because the line inset now takes various arguments.

- LFUN_TOC_INSERT ("toc-insert"): use "inset-insert toc" instead.


The following LyX functions have been changed:

- LFUN_INSET_TOGGLE ("inset-toggle"): For some insets, this function was used 
  to show the settings dialog. This is no longer possible and one should use
  inset-settings for this purpose.
 
- LFUN_WORD_REPLACE ("word-replace"): The replacement and searched strings
  arguments have been inverted in order to allow the replacement of the word
  at current cursor position, even if it is not selected.

- LFUN_OPTIONAL_INSERT ("optional-insert") has been renamed LFUN_ARGUMENT_INSERT
  ("argument-insert").


The following LyX key bindings have been changed:

- LFUN_MATH_MACRO_FOLD ("math-macro-fold")
  The binding to "C-minus" has changed to "C-S-underscore".

- LFUN_MATH_MACRO_UNFOLD ("math-macro-unfold")
  The binding to "C-plus" has changed to "C-S-asterisk".


New external programs and libaries:
-----------------------------------

LyX 2.0 introduces support for some new external helper programs/libraries,
while the support for some existing programs has been dropped. This
particularly applies to spell checking and the thesaurus.

1.) SPELLCHECKING:

* Direct support for ispell and hspell has been dropped. However, ispell
  and hspell are still accessible via the enchant wrapper (see below).

* Support for the aspell command line program has been dropped. Note that
  the aspell library (aspell 0.60.x) is still supported.
  
* As well as the aspell library, LyX now also supports hunspell (the spell
  checker used by OpenOffice and Firefox) and enchant, a wrapper that
  provides automatic access to many spell checking libraries (ispell,
  aspell, hspell, hunspell, etc.).

* On Mac OSX, Apple's Spell Server is preconfigured as the "native" spell 
  checker.

LyX 2.0 is configured for any and all of these three possibilities,
given that the various libraries are installed on the machine where LyX is 
configured. The actual spell checker can be selected in Tools > Preferences.
Packagers are advised to pre-select whatever is most common on their
platform/distribution.

2.) THESAURUS:

* Support for the aiksaurus library has been dropped in favour of the
  MyThes thesaurus library (the thesaurus library used by OpenOffice).
  
* LyX ships the MyThes library itself, so unlike in LyX 1.6.x, no extra 
  thesaurus library needs to be installed. However, LyX does not ship any 
  thesaurus dictionaries, and those do have to be installed separately.

* The OpenOffice thesaurus dictionaries can be used, but the path to those
  dictionaries needs to be set in Tools > Preferences. Please refer to the
  UserGuide, sec. 6.13, for further instructions.

Packagers are advised to preset the thesaurus for their distribution/
platform. Packagers of installation bundles (on Windows and the Mac)
are advised to provide automatic installation of thesaurus dictionaries
in the installation process (analoguous to the spellchecker installation).

3.) LILYPOND:

There is now direct support for Lilypond-book. Note that LyX requires at
least version 2.14 for proper work.

4.) INSTANT PREVIEW:

Make sure that dv2dt (often part of LaTeX distributions) is installed
on your system.


Known issues in version 2.0.0
-----------------------------

- LyX needs to be run under Python 2 and will not work properly on systems
  where Python 3 is the default binary. See bug #7030 to know how to fix
  this properly, since simple sheebang conversion in *.py files will not
  be enough.

Caveats when upgrading from earlier versions to 2.0.x
-------------------------------------------------------

- The syntax of the languages file has been changed. If you use a modified
  languages file, you will need to adapt it to the new syntax, as LyX 2.0
  is not able to read old languages file anymore.
  Please refer to the beginning of the languages file for an explanation
  of the new syntax.

- There has been a large change in how Flex insets are named. Previously,
  they tended to have names like "CharStyle:Noun". Now, they just have
  names like "Flex:Noun" (where "Flex" is a namespace that is optional).
  When LyX 2.0 reads older files, it silently converts the old-style names
  to new-style names; this direction works perfectly. It will also silently
  revert new-style names to old-style names, when exporting to 1.6.x format,
  but only for the pre-defined LyX insets. This means that user-defined flex
  insets will not be properly reverted.
  To solve this problem, you can modify the file $LYXDIR/lyx2lyx/lyx_2_0.py.
  In that file, you will find the following:
    flex_insets = {
      "Alert" : "CharStyle:Alert",
      "Code" : "CharStyle:Code",
      "Concepts" : "CharStyle:Concepts",
      "E-Mail" : "CharStyle:E-Mail",
      "Emph" : "CharStyle:Emph",
      "Expression" : "CharStyle:Expression",
      "Initial" : "CharStyle:Initial",
      "Institute" : "CharStyle:Institute",
      "Meaning" : "CharStyle:Meaning",
      "Noun" : "CharStyle:Noun",
      "Strong" : "CharStyle:Strong",
      "Structure" : "CharStyle:Structure",
      "ArticleMode" : "Custom:ArticleMode",
      "Endnote" : "Custom:Endnote",
      "Glosse" : "Custom:Glosse",
      "PresentationMode" : "Custom:PresentationMode",
      "Tri-Glosse" : "Custom:Tri-Glosse"
    }
  This is a map form new-style names (minux "Flex") to old-style names (and
  there is a similar for DocBook elements). To get a user-defined CharStyle
  to revert properly, it simply needs to be added to this list.
