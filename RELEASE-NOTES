This file lists interface changes that might affect users in 1.6.0, some 
known problems in LyX 1.6.0 and some things you have to take into account
when upgrading from earlier versions to a version of the 1.6.x series.
Note that fixes are available for some of these, but they have not yet
been applied because of incomplete testing.


Interface changes
-----------------

Some of the LyX functions have changed names:

- A new LFUN_SPECIALCHAR_INSERT has been implemented that obsoletes the
  different LFUNs for single special characters:

- The function LFUN_BREAK_LINE, "break-line" has been renamed to LFUN_NEWLINE_INSERT,
  "newline-insert", and it now allows two options: "newline-insert newline" inserts
  a \newline, "newline-insert linebreak" inserts a \linebreak.

  custom insets and XML short element insets.

  These can be used in export mode to turn branches on and off. 
  Thus, something like:
    lyx -e pdf2 -x "branch-activate answers" finalexam.lyx
  could be used to export a pdf with the answers branch included, without 
  one's having to open LyX and activate the branch manually.

The following new LyX functions have been removed:

- LFUN_FILE_NEW.

- LFUN_BREAK_PARAGRAPH_KEEP_LAYOUT.

  via "space-insert hfill".

Known issues in version 1.6.0

Caveats when upgrading from earlier versions to 1.6.x
-------------------------------------------------------

The support for Japanese has been improved in LyX 1.6.x. Due to encoding
reasons, Japanese documents that were edited with LyX 1.6.x cannot correctly
be converted to the format of LyX 1.5.x and thus not edited with LyX 1.5.x.
To be able to use LyX 1.6 with Japanese, the latest version of the LaTeX
distribution "platex" must be installed.
platex provides a Japanese variant of BibTeX named "jbibtex". When LyX is
configured, this variant is used. In case you have problems with BibTeX-files
that include Japanese or you need to use another BibTeX program, set it in LyX
preferences under Output->LaTeX->BibTeX command.
