This file lists interface changes that might affect users in 2.1.0, some 
known problems in LyX 2.1.0 and some things you have to take into account
when upgrading from earlier versions to a version of the 2.1.x series.


Interface changes
-----------------

Whenever the user closes a (tabbed) view on a document, either by
clicking on the tab close button, or by using the File->Close menu,
LyX now closes exclusively that specific view. If there are other
views showing the same document, they are not closed. When the user
closes the last view, LyX can be configured for either closing the
document, or keeping it into memory as a hidden document (that can be
shown again through the View->Hidden-> submenu).

A new configurable preference option has been added, allowing for either
(close_buffer_with_last_view)

There have been some changes to the LyX command line. The following new
options have been added:

-export-to <format> <dest>    (-E <format> <dest>)

  Allows one to perform a batch export of the LyX file that is opened
  to the specified destination file <dest> and format <format>.
  For example, to create a PDF of a LyX document, you can run:
    lyx -export-to pdf /path/to/dest.pdf /path/to/source.lyx
  See the manual page for details.
  This functionality is also available via a new menu voice
  Export->Export As..., that pops up a dialog allowing one to
  choose the export format, as well as the destination pathname.
  Also, it is available via the mini-buffer (or the -x switch)
  through a proper new LFUN (see below).

The Advanced Find and Replace feature now supports cancel of a long
search operation by hitting the ESC key.

The following pref variables were changed in 2.1:

- \\close_buffer_with_last_view [yes|no|ask]
  When user closes the last view on a document, close the document
  as well ("yes"), or hide the document ("no"), or ask the user
  ("ask").

The following pref variables are obsoleted in 2.1:

- \\default_language
- \\default_papersize

To set the default language and paper size for new documents, use the
"Save As Document Defaults" button in Document > Settings.

The format pdf aka "PDF (ps2pdf)" was split in two formats: pdf aka
"PDF (ps2pdf)" and pdf6 aka "PDF (graphics)". pdf6 is used for PDF files
included as graphics. Custom external templates and converters might need
to be adjusted. The format split was needed since otherwise an odt->pdf
converter which is intended for included graphics only did interfere with
document export via ps2pdf.

The support for ArmTeX (a special typesetting engine for Armenian) was removed.
Writing text in Armenian is now possible in a native way using XeTeX.

The following new LyX functions have been introduced:

- LFUN_BRANCH_MASTER_ACTIVATE <branch>:
  LFUN_BRANCH_MASTER_DEACTIVATE <branch>:
  Activates or deactivates a branch in a master document from within
  a child (as opposed to the existing LFUN_BRANCH_[DE]ACTIVATE, which
  toggle the branch in the document itself).

- LFUN_BUFFER_EXPORT_AS <format> <filename>
  Equivalent to the new -export-to command-line switch (see above).

- LFUN_CLIPBOARD_PASTE_SIMPLE ("clipboard-paste-simple")
  Paste the clipboard contents as simple unformatted text.
  This is also available through a new menu voice within the
  [Edit]->[Paste Special...] sub-menu.

- LFUN_VIEW_CLOSE
  Close the current document view only, if there are no more views
  on the document, either close or hide it (see the new preference
  option \\close_buffer_with_last_view)

The following LyX functions have been removed:

//template, remove this entry later on
- LFUN_NEXT_INSET_TOGGLE ("next-inset-toggle"): use "inset-toggle" instead.


The following LyX functions have been changed:

//template, remove this entry later on
- LFUN_INSET_TOGGLE ("inset-toggle"): For some insets, this function was used 
  to show the settings dialog. This is no longer possible and one should use
  inset-settings for this purpose.
 
-  LFUN_CLOSE_TAB_GROUP_CLOSE ("close-tab-group") was renamed to
   LFUN_TAB_GROUP_CLOSE ("tab-group-close").

-  LFUN_SPIT_VIEW ("split-view") was renamed to
   LFUN_VIEW_SPLIT ("view-split").

- LFUN_BREAK_PARAGRAPH ("break-paragraph") was renamed to
  LFUN_PARAGRAPH_BREAK ("paragraph-break").

The following LyX key bindings have been changed:

//template, remove this entry later on
- LFUN_MATH_MACRO_FOLD ("math-macro-fold")
  The binding to "C-minus" has changed to "C-S-underscore".

- The binding "C-w" was moved from "buffer-close" to "view-close"
  (only in cua.bind).


Linux desktop file specification and scalable icon has been included
into the tarball.


New external programs and libraries:
------------------------------------

- LyX links now against libmagic (http://www.darwinsys.com/file/) if it is
  available at compile time. This improves the file format detection of
  included graphics and other files. The old builtin format detection code
  is used if libmagic is not available.


Known issues in version 2.1.0
-----------------------------

- LyX needs to be run under Python 2 and will not work properly on systems
  where Python 3 is the default binary. See bug #7030 to know how to fix
  this properly, since simple sheebang conversion in *.py files will not
  be enough.

Caveats when upgrading from earlier versions to 2.1.x
-------------------------------------------------------

In order to improve reported scrolling slowness, we changed the way screen
painting is done. This, however, can slow down the performance on remote
X connections and we provide RC_USE_QIMAGE variable, which brings back
the old way of painting (when set to false).
