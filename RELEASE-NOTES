This file lists interface changes that might affect users in 1.6.0, some 
known problems in LyX 1.6.0 and some things you have to take into account
when upgrading from earlier versions to a version of the 1.6.x series.
Note that fixes are available for some of these, but they have not yet
been applied because of incomplete testing.


Interface changes
-----------------

Some of the LyX functions have changed names :


Known issues in version 1.5.2
------------------------------------

- LyX might crash if you switch the encoding of a document while the
  View->Source pane is opened.

- LyX might suddenly slow down when you have copied something in another
  instance of LyX or in another application. Known workaround: Ctrl+C of
  some text inside the active window bring the speed back.

- Cursor restoration problems with Multiple-View:
  When using multiple Windows to edit different parts of the
  same document, the cursor position is sometimes not correctly restored
  when you switch from one view to the other.

- RTL and keymaps:
  Currently there is a bug where you can't use two non-RTL language keymaps if
  the RTL preference is set (which is now the default). If you need to use two
  non-RTL keymaps, for now you should just turn off the RTL preference (Tools -> 
  Preferences... -> Language settings -> Language, uncheck "Right-to-left
  language support").
  We hope to offer more comprehensive support for multiple keymaps in the future,
  which will solve this bug, as well as allow more than just two keymaps. If you 
  have any input on this issue, please chime in on the developers mailing list,
  or add your comments to http://bugzilla.lyx.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4051.


Caveats when upgrading from earlier versions to 1.5.x
-------------------------------------------------------

Due to the change to Unicode, there are some general things you'll have to take care
about when upgrading from an older version to LyX 1.5.0 or newer. Please refer to the
file UPGRADING for details.
