How do I upgrade my existing LyX system to version 1.1.6?
---------------------------------------------------------

If you upgrade from version 1.1.6 or 1.1.5, you shouldn't have any
problems. It is nevertheless a goo idea to advise all users to run
Edit>Reconfigure.

If you have your own layout files, you may need to update them a little:

- all layout files should have a "DefaultStyle" entry

- the "Latex" font style does not exist anymore. If you really need
  its functionality, consider using the "PassThru" keyword instead.

The new layout format keywords are described in the Customization
manual.

Document transfer
-----------------

In general, you don't need to convert any documents saved with LyX
1.1.5 or 1.1.6 to use them with LyX 1.2.0.

LyX 1.2.0 can read all documents saved with lyx 1.1.6 correctly.
However, older LyX versions will almost certainly fail to read files
produced by LyX 1.2.0.

Note that the babel package is now loaded after the user-defined
preamble (because some packages really need to be loaded before
babel). If you relied, on babel being loaded before your own
definitions, you can add an extra "\usepackage{babel}" statement at
the beginning of your preamble.
