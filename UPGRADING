How do I upgrade my existing LyX system to version 1.2.x?
---------------------------------------------------------

If you upgrade from version 1.1.6 or 1.1.5, you shouldn't have any
problems. It is nevertheless a good idea to advise all users to run
Edit->Reconfigure.

If you have your own layout files, you may need to update them a little:

- all layout files should have a "DefaultStyle" entry

- the "Latex" font style does not exist anymore. If you really need
  its functionality, consider using the "PassThru" keyword instead.

The new layout format keywords are described in the Customization
manual.

Build requirements
------------------

LyX's graphics handling system has changed substantially. If you
do not have the JPEG library installed, you may need to install
it before you can use the graphics capabilities of LyX. If you
do not have the ImageMagick command-line tools installed, you
will need to modify the default set up of LyX, or install them,
in order to get previews of your document's graphics.

Note: if you are using convert, and the graphics won't load in LyX,
then you are probably seeing a bug in earlier versions of ImageMagick.
You can either upgrade ImageMagick, change the convertor to use
"convert -depth 8", which shold work around the problem, or set up
a convertor to use a different conversion program as described in
the documentation.

Document transfer
-----------------

In general, you don't need to convert any documents saved with LyX
1.1.5 or 1.1.6 to use them with LyX 1.2.0.

Older versions of LyX cannot read documents saved with LyX 1.2.0.
 
LyX 1.2.0 can read most documents saved with lyx 1.1.6 correctly.

If you were previously using the floatflt paragraph option to
wrap text around a figure, you will need to modify this for LyX 1.2.0
manually, as described in the manuals. Please ask on the lyx-users
list for assistance if you have trouble with this.
 
Note that your document may rely on the floatflt package (for example,
you may use \floatingfigure via LaTeX commands). If your document does
not have "\usepackage{floatflt}" already in the user pre-amble, you will
need to add it.
 
The babel package is now loaded after the user-defined
preamble (because some packages really need to be loaded before
babel). If you relied, on babel being loaded before your own
definitions, you can add an extra "\usepackage{babel}" statement at
the beginning of your preamble.

If you are using the minipage paragraph options in your document, you
may find that LyX 1.2.0 fails to import them correctly as minipages.
This might require some editing to correct this. If you have
trouble with this, please ask the lyx-users mailing list for assistance,
and we will be happy to help.
